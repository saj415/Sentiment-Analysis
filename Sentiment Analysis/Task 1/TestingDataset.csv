1,5,"I'm a semi-pro player, and this tuner is all I need.  A great buy, worth the money.  The simplicity of the design and the beautiful full color screen are my favorite features of the Snark Sn-1."
0,3,"This tuner is nice , inexpensive and very easy to use.  It does a very nice job keeping the instrument tuned"
1,5,I have tried several different kinds of guitar tuners and of the ones I have tried the Snark is the best. It is more precise easier to operate and just simply looks prettier. I highly recommend this tuner.
1,5,"Solid tuner, more accurate than I anticipated and very easy to use. It will get you extremely close and for the size and functionality it seems to be the best product of it's kind that I've used."
1,5,the snark tuner is theBEST one I have owned  extremely accurate  easy to use  very reasonably priced for such a good piecehave paid lots more for products that were harder and not as accurate
1,5,Excellent little device for the money.  Easy to use.  I have paid double for tuners that have not worked as well.  This will get you in tune for $11 or less - can't beat it.
1,5,"I own several of the Snark tuners.  The SN-1 settles quickly, and works with a wide array of instruments.  Tuning couldn't be simpler.  Just clip it to your instrument and strum or play a note and, in an instant, there it is.  The display is bright and easy to read, and the graph has a lot of resolution.  The SN-1 senses frequency through vibration.  It is transposable, and it offers a metronome feature.  The SN-1 is finished with a rubbery texture and is a beautiful &#34;electric blue&#34; color."
1,4,"I like the way the Snark attaches to all of my guitars and a mandolin. It reacts quickly and is not over-sensitive. The way the mounting and dial articulate make it easy to set up while not interfering with the tuning knobs. Easy to read and for the very low price a great value. However, and this may be my own fault, I often need to snap my finger against the dial to get it to start reading. I say my own fault because I put the battery in wrong the first time and had to pull it out with needlenose pliers. That may have damaged a contact. I play with a number of other people that have Snarks and they all work properly. I would buy another one without hesitation."
1,5,Since this my first Snark SN-1 Tuner I am very pleased with performance it gives me accurate read outs against built in tuners on the guitars (Acoustic) that is. Like all all functions it has looking forward to maybe upgrading to the next model or so just have a few around for each instrument.
1,5,"If you are a beginning guitarist, like myself, you probably can't tell one note from another. This product does all the hard work for you easily, quickly and accurately. The only thing I needed to know but didn't was that if you get a reading of G and you need to make the reading B for the B string, the notes follow the alphabet from A to G and then begin again. So you are turning in the right direction from G if the next note is A. The one after A will be B. Seems simple enough if you know anything about music. I didn't."
1,4,"This is a great little tuner.  Used it for more than a year with no issues.  Fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar.  It also has an excellent display for showing you how sharp or flat you are.  The only reason I didn't make this a five star rating is that I discovered the Planet Waves PW-CT-12 NS Mini Headstock Tuner.  If it was a choice between the 2, the Planet Waves wins, hands down.  But this is excellent for what it is:  an easy-to-clip-on tuner that can be used on any instrument.  I've even set it down on my elementary classroom autoharp and it tuned it to perfection."
1,5,One of biggest hurdles for any instrument player is keeping your instrument in tune.  With this little gadget there is no guess work.  Clamp it onto the headstock of your guitar and pluck each string and bring each one into tune. I love this little gadget and the price is super on Amazon!
0,3,"I have to edit my once five star review because twice in a row I recieved a tuner in the mail, and after less than one week the screen goes totally dim. I Can't imagine this is the battery since that is supposed to last a year and I only used the tuner 4-5 times for less than a minute each time. It's so dim I can barley see the reading when I squint. It's only $10 just a pain to wait two weeks for amazon to give a refund. I'll be buying another one and trying it again! Good tuner, unlucky with two lemons I guess."
1,5,"This is the best clip on tuner out there.  It's dead accurate, doesn't bounce around like dial needle tuners, and it's EASY TO READ!  You just clip it to your headstock, either acoustic or electric, turn it on, position the face toward you and start tuning very quickly.  Highly recommended for all string players, especially electric or acoustic guitar or Dobro.  There are other tuners by Snark that are more sensitive to lower ranges and higher ranges, so check out what suits your needs."
1,4,...but what you ask? This tuner gets the job done but the part that connects the clip to the tuner is very weak and can break off easily. Mine broke and so did my friend's. It's probably cheaper to just buy a new one than to get a replacement clip.
1,4,"Not quite as good as the red All Instrument Snark, but it gets the job done and the price is right."
0,1,Very accurate tuner BUT it broke within the first week I used it.  The little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when  you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless.  I will try to get a replacement... Now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need.
1,5,"The Snark SN-1 is small, accurate and easy to use. I have a more ""sophisticated"" tuner and the Snark works faster and is much easier to use."
1,5,"I've been playing for over 30 years and now have three different electronic tuners, so I'm a good judge of the Snark:PROS:  It's chromatic so it's good for every tuning job; no need to plug it into your jack; ambient noise doesn't affect it; great sharp, colorful display; reacts quickly; small enough to fit easily in my case; cool blue color; built-in metronome; powers down automatically to save the battery; transposes up to four steps if you're using a capo; will even identify major chords.CONS:  Works better on acoustics and semi-hollows than on solid bodied guitars; made me realize that three of my strings need intonating (or is that a PRO?); metronome is visual only; manual says that long-term use of the clip in one spot can damage some guitars' finishes; big blue thing on your guitar looks weird.Now that I have the Snark I have officially retired my other two tuners.  This is easier to use, easier to carry around, you don't have to unplug from your amp, it works on acoustic or electric, and it's chromatic.  And it's cheap.  Definitely recommended."
1,5,"so cheap I bought one for each of my ukuleles..  would never use a pitch pipe again, and I guess I might be tone deaf cuz i cannot tune them without these."
1,5,I got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it.  I have a stompbox tuner but this Shark is really fantastic.Easy to use and very accurate.  It makes tuning a breeze.
1,5,"At first I was skeptical of this nifty little tuner, but since I've been using it for the past few weeks, I've yet to have one complaint. It sits right atop, clipped to the guitar, operates on vibrations, so doesn't pic up other guitars, is light, barely even notice it, and seems quite accurate."
1,5,"I received this yesterday and it is the best tuner for my acoustic guitar.  This is the second one I have and it works well.  I have a built in tuner, but the Snark is so easy to use and inexpensive, it is a great deal.  I would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player."
1,5,"Bright easy to read display, adjusts to face any direction, so I can even use it with my Telecaster which has very little room on the headstock.  Accurate and fast. Can't beat the price, and battery compartment is easy to open, unlike some other tuners I have."
1,5,"Started to take guitar lessons locally to balance out the DVD's and books, and my teach used a clip-on tuner and my interest went sky high. (I am a professional drummer with serious guitar envy)All I can say is GOODBY JACK-IN TUNERS.With this little baby it makes no difference whether you are playing an electric guitar/bass or an acoustic, and you can tune on the fly with the thing clipped on to your headstock all the time. Admittedly you can do this with with a jack-in tuner without the jack-in part, but the results aren't always that good, and you have to fish around for the tuner.The whole turn the amp down, unplug from the amp, jack into a tuner, unplug from the tuner, plug back into the amp, turn the amp up process every time something sounded a bit off always soured me and brought down my enthusiasm while practicing/playing the guitar, but those days are over. I need to keep my enthusiasm level high, and actually play the guitar instead of fishing around for a tuner.As far as accuracy, it is as good, or better than any jack-in tuner I have (I have three different brands)."
1,5,"I have no complaints except when I try to tune my guitar a half step down, there are buttons for that on the back of the tuner but I have zero clue how to use them. This tuner is perfect it sits nicely on the head, swiveling head, visible from wherever you are."
1,5,"This tuner is great, and it being so low price makes it even more better, standard shipping took 2 days to reach me in Mass. I was pleased for that. The tuner comes with a 2032 (circle) battery, and its as simple as pushing the power button and strumming the guitar strings. I'd definitely recommend this product to a friend. I'd buy it again. Its a nice little tuner, and my guitar is sounding great. This is a very well made product."
1,5,"I bought one of these at a music store like 2 years ago for 30 bucks. I was Impressed and used i to tune my guitar, bass and mandolin. Later I saw them for 8$ here on amazon and I bought 1 for myself 1 for a sister and another for my brother in law. These are a great deal. I can tune my electric bass without a pedal while the stage is really loud! It just uses vibration of the instrument."
1,5,"These tuners (including the red version) are the best. I have many tuners, from expensive Peterson and Boss, Korg, Seiko, Quiktune, and many other brands, from standard tuners to a few different brands of clip ons. The Snark is the easiest and most stable to use. Even my young guitar students, who have had trouble learning to tune using other tuners that I love, have no problem tuning with this tuner."
1,5,"I am but a mere novice when it comes to playing the guitar, but I purchased this SN-1 to replace the piece of junk first tuner I had. I'm very happy with the size of the SN-1. It's small, much smaller than I expected which was a big bonus. It takes up very little room on the headstock, and does not interfere when I make tuning adjustments. The &#34;chip-clip&#34; style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my Ibanez acoustic and I *think* my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tuner.The user interface is very simple, and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions. The instruction manual is adequate, but the SN-1 seemed very intuitive for me to use. The product arrived on time, as shown, well packaged, for what I believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change. I've had this SN-1 for a couple months now, and will update this review down the road. Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will do the best I can to answer.SPO"
1,5,I had to tune my guitar and I bought this. Well it works great. I got the sound I wanted.
1,5,"I've bought quite a few tuners over the years. These are small, responsive, easy to read, and the fact that they work on vibration means they can be used in a loud setting without interference. These are great!!At first I was turned off by the 'toyish' appearance, but decided to try it after reading the reviews. Let me say that in person they look nicer than in the pics, and they perform way better than I expected."
1,4,I tune both my acoustic and electric guitars with it and it appears to do a good job on both. I didn't think it would pick up the vibration on the electric very well but it does and without it being attached to the amp. It appears to do a better and faster job than my old seiko electric guitar tuner. I would have gave it a five star but being a beginner and not having developed a good musical ear yet I don't know if it is tuning the guitars as well as some other unit. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good inexpensive tuner.Update: The more I use this tuner the more I like it. It is easy to read and use and doesn't appear to be as easily broken as other reviewers say theirs was. Of course I am careful with it a keep it put away when not being used.
1,5,I had a little dificulty learning how to tune it at the beginning but after i played with it enough i figured it out and its so easy to use and my friends love it they say s*** im gonna by me one lol
1,5,"When this arrived I didn't realize it was that small. Thought it has to be so its out of the way. Then I thought, this thing can't work very well, but it does perfectly. The first few times a used it, I wasn't expecting muchhowever, I couldn't more wrong it really works well and I would recommend this to family or friends."
1,5,"I was surprised by the size...very small and unobtrusive. My older guitar has a decal on the top of the head which made the small size a bit of an issue, but with the cleverly designed swivel pad and wide opening on the clip of the Snark, I could still easily manage it.The tuning is dead-on, and couldn't be more convenient. Since it's based on vibration, the performance is completely unaffected by outside noise. Also, you don't have to try and balance anything on your knee or use a table to hold your standard audio tuner. Just clip it on and swivel the head to face you.I really like the design. Attractive but not overly loud in color, and a nice non-slip surface. The display is bright and the interface is very intuitive...you just press the button and start plucking strings.In addition, Snark's customer service was very friendly and helpful.Putting my two cents aside(that anyone who plays the guitar should learn to tune by sound, without a tuner, given one of the notes), I highly recommend the Snark tuner."
1,5,Purchased this Snark tuner after reading a few positive reviews and decided to give it a try. For the money I figured why not.GREAT little tuner. Dead on accuracy and perfect for tuning in rooms where you may have noise interference using regular tuners. This clips to the headstock and  is very easy to use.The face pivots around and the display is nice and bright. I will pick up a few more and toss em in my guitar cases!
1,5,This tuner is easy to use.  I have a guitar with a built in tuner that just doesn't seem to be perfect on pitch.  This tuner is and I am very happy with this purchase.
1,5,"not much to say, if you play guitar buy one, you'll never be out of tune again, lets you tune anytime, i never even take mine off, no more ""does this sound in tune"" because it will always be in tune, so do your self a favor and go out and buy one, very affordable (you could collect enough cans to buy this in a couple hours)so enjoy"
1,5,"I have seen people complain about battery life. I turn it on, tune, and then turn it off and my batteries last forever. The display is good, and the tuners work well. I have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity. I think it is a well made product and good value. Thank god for tuners. There is nothing worse than a bunch of out-of-tune, loud guitar players."
1,5,"The Snark SN-1 is sometimes dissed because of it being slightly inaccurate. I beg to differ. This is the most accurate headstock tuner that I have ever used, and it also has a built in metronome, which I never use, but could come in handy. Another thing is the price point, which is simply amazing. The blue color is a bit annoying however, and I'd like it if they came out with a black SN-1. The visibility of the screen is amazing, and I can see it even with the sun reflecting off of it, or in a completely dark room."
1,5,"I've got a bunch of these little tuners- I keep one with each instrument. They are a little tough on batteries, but they are accurate, even picking up notes below E on my double bass C extension.Highly recommend!"
1,4,Tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice.  This device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy.  Why you would almost think I know what I am doing.
1,5,This was a great purchase.  My son found exactly what he needed and at a price he could afford.  He would definitely purchase from here again.
1,5,"Who doesn't love these tuners?  Easy to use, easy to read, and has options that I don't even use. Highly recommend this."
1,5,"I've tried the Fishman FT-1 and the Tune Tech ttm-201.  I like this one the best.It seems as accurate as my other tuners.  Like all clip on tuners there are ""sweet spots"" on the head that work better than others.  Oddly the Snark likes different spots from the Fishman or Tune Tech.  I tested the Snark against them, my Korg tuner and my Android App tuner.  The Snark was fine.The biggest plus I see on the Snark and the reason its my new ""go to"" tuner on the guitar is the large bright screen.  My vision isn't so great in dim light and the clarity and brightness is wonderful.  I don't have to guess or squint.It has a metronome which can be fun.  I personally don't use it because these hearing aid batteries are a bother so I don't want to waste the energy on a metronome and not have the tuning function work when I really need it.The only minus that I can possibly see is that the clamp is pretty fierce.  I don't have a custom made Brazilian rosewood guitar where the headstock could be marked by this thing.  If you do have something expensive check this clip out first to be sure you'll trust it.  If not then the Fishman is more your speed."
1,4,"Tuner works well with acoustic but not so great when your electric is not plugged in. Seem like it needs more resonant vibration to register the sound. Sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit, and it's okay. I also have the NS Micro, and that's a better tuner."
1,5,"I bought this because I got tired of looking up by-ear tuners online. It's so darn simple to use. Just clip it on, tap the big button, and play a note. The chromatic tuner is extremely easy to read and incredibly simple, and it automatically recognizes which notes are being played and adjusts to the note as you tune up and down. It was also very cheap compared to the other box tuners. Overall this is an amazing product and I don't see a reason why I would ever want another tuner again. I've had this tuner for about a month now and it hasn't failed me yet, though sometimes it can be a little stubborn and slow with determining when a note is being played and it does have a habit of being right on the mark one time, then if you pluck the string again, it will show it's off tune by a quarter-step or so. Just make sure you tune all the strings twice, and you won't regret buying this tuner."
1,5,"works right out of the box.  Easy to read, easy to use......arrived very fast inexcellent shape....just had to put the supplied battery into it"
1,5,"I have several different tunes, but the Snark is hands down the fastest and most sensitive. Has no trouble whatever picking up the low e-string on my Seagull acoustic, which flummoxes my Intelli 600. Having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier. The only down side, and this is a matter of taste, is the garish color. You shouldn't leave these things on the headstock anyway as they can leave a mark, so the hideous color just encourages me to do the deed and put it away, which may be just as well."
1,5,i got this as a gift for the my guitar mentor and lead guitar player in my band.  i have a tuner built in to my amp i use but he has always tuned by ear which is hard to do on stage or even at rehearsal.  the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it.
1,5,"A great little tuner. Very accurate, easy to use and the batteries last the better part of a year. I bought 3 or 4 of these and I put in my gig bags or cases. At these prices you can afford to clip the on to all your instruments."
1,5,These Snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick. I use the mic instead of the vibration setting though. That's my preference. But I would use no other tuner on stage. I have one on each of my guitars including my acoustic guitars. I have dozens of guitars!
1,5,"Very useful for acoustic guitars, electric and bass. If you don't have a pedal board with a tuner, this is invaluable to quickly tune up. Small form factor and can be thrown into a guitar case. Good accuracy compared to my Korg pitchblack"
0,1,"Like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off. I tried to glue it back on, but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that. If you buy this, you really need to baby it! My advice is look for a more sturdy model!"
1,5,"Okay.. I used to tune my guitar online.... However, adding a $10 for this item is worth it... It is so accurate and works great so far... I saw that some people complaint that the tuner comes without a battery, but mine come with one... Probably it is because I bought it from amazon &lt; not from some sort of seller in amazon> ... Moreover, there's also a warranty for this item... For those who want to start playing a guitar like me, I strongly recommend to get this tuner!!... You won't regret!!..Owyea.."
1,5,"Awesome little tuner, very accurate and I can store it almost anywhere. much cheaper online too, for the price its a steal."
1,5,"this tuner is awsome,it tunes very acurately and i would recommend it to any guitarist or who ever needs a tunner."
1,5,I wasn't expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner. I have to say it is one good (funny looking)clip on tuner. Many useful functions. I especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything. Like the capo and metronome feature. I just really like this little guy. Good job Snark.
1,5,I haven't had to change the battery on this bad boy in over two years since I've had it!  It also is bright and is very accurate.  If looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further!
1,5,"The tabs broke off right out of the package (the other reviews made me aware this may happen). An easy fix with some Super Glue and for the price, who cares if I have to fix it. It is 100% accurate and very easy to use. Other than the tabs breaking it is a great little tuner for the money. Highly Recommend!!"
1,5,I use this tuner to tune up my violin.  Other tuners I've tried using the vibration setting had difficulty feeling the &#34;E&#34; string vibrations thus making it hard to tune.  This tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all 4 strings.
1,5,"This little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments.  Just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds.  I've even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitch.Pros:- Dead-on accurate.  You can easily set your intonation with this little monster.- Works great in extremely loud environments.- Clips on tightly.  If you don't jump around like an orangutan on stage, you could probably have the Snark ride your headstock through the whole show.- You don't have to plug into it.- Extremely responsive.- Enough display detail for you to know when you're getting close to in tune -- not just 3 indicators like some tuners (flat, dead-on, sharp).- Very inexpensive.Cons:- A little twitchy on the open low B string on bass. I use the 12th fret harmonics (first partial) to tune, however, since it's a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more, so this has never really been a problem for me.Inexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case -- for every instrument you own."
1,5,"Works great, seems durable, shipped fast.  Can't think of a single negative thing about this product.  If you need a tuner, this ones a good one."
1,4,"I bought this to replace the inexpensive Musedo T-50 tuner that came bundled with my Kala KA-S ukulele. The Snark SN-2 is much more accurate, but its LCD display is not very bright, and has a narrow field of view. (Yes, I did try a fresh battery, but it made no difference.) I wish it were brighter and easier to see. Still, it's a very good tuner overall."
1,4,"The tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks. It may be my imagination, but I think the recent ones work a little differently than previous generations. They seem to register differently than older ones and sometimes give you a tuning that is just a wee bit sharp.I have used them to tune many different kinds of string instruments, from autoharps to mandolins to guitars. It works with all of them.Tuning by vibration is very useful in a loud room, but it is not always perfect. If another band is playing loudly, the sound vibrations from the speakers will affect your ability to tune. So you have to wait until the band is between songs to get an accurate reading.To my taste, the display on these SN-2's is the best of all the Snarks. I like the extra bars and the smoothness of the way the display zeroes in to the perfect pitch. It looks nice and responds well to your tuning peg changes.Finally, do not drop these. The head is purposely flexible and can rotate very easily. It has a ball joint construction. That is good, and seems to hold up to use. The plastic socket, however, on the back of the tuning head does not respond well to hitting the floor, even a carpeted floor. I do not treat my tuners rough, but it is easy to drop them. When you do, 6 out of 10 times, the plastic socket will break. I have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base. They still tune, but I have to hold them against the guitar. They do not clip on any more, so it is inconvenient."
1,5,"I thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk. Because well these days you usually get even a little less than what you pay for. But this tuner destroyed those expectations. Its a small, ""smart"" tuner. So many functions and just a great design. Its really cool that I dont have to go hunt down a tuner that could be lost in my room somewhere. This attached to basically any guitar, or almost any object for that matter. The only thing negative I have to say is, im not so sure you can plug a cable into it. Which you would expect with ALL the other stuff it comes with. Otherwise, its pretty great."
1,5,"This is just the tuner I was looking for! It works on vibration or mic, so it's very versatile. It works on my acoustic, bass, electric, and my mother's voice. Haven't tried the trumpet yet... Intuitive and the back-lit screen is so easy to see!"
1,5,This tuner is very accurate.  It is well made and stays on without falling off.  I tested it with other tuners and it's right on. Easy to see when positioned correctly.
0,3,"It is bright, easy to attach to my guitar but there are some problems with it being so ""fragile"" at the base.  The battery was a bit tricky to insert since it is so close to the base. I like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic. Be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off. It is very sensitive and has been more accurate than a Planet Waves tuner I currently own. Would I buy it again? I don't know. Going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate. Looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way."
1,5,"This is a very inexpensive and very accurate tuner.  The Vibration Mode is really good. I am a new guitar player, and this item has helped me greatly in quickly tuning my guitar."
0,3,"I bought this tuner mainly for my acoustic guitar; I have a Sabine tuner with a mini-mike but unplugging the tuner from my amp, having the room completely quiet and the tuner in a good position is a couple of extra steps I'd rather not go through.  This tuner is compact and works well; I clip it onto whatever guitar I pick up for a quick tune (acoustic OR electric), push the power button, and off I go.  I haven't fooled with the other features (Metronome? Detuning?), so I can't comment about them.  An added comment: I broke off one of the flimsy little tabs that holds onto the ball joint from it being overextended.  My fault, but it shouldn't have broken so easily.  I'm sure they could make the plastic tabs just a wee bit stronger/thicker, or make it so it pops out of the joint when overextended instead of breaking completely."
1,5,"This has got to be the best little tuner I've ever owned, and the cheapest too.  I have a $100 tuner that works nicely, but this one will handle any instrument you clip it to.  The SN-2 has the vibration pickup abitity that the SN-1 doesn't.  So I use it on all my instruments except my sitar as there's no place to clip it.  I highly recommend it."
1,5,This is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use. It's easy to setup out of the box and can tune via vibration or microphone. It's easy to figure out if the strings are in pitch or not. The only downside is that it feels a bit flimsy sometimes.
0,3,I've owned four of these over the past two years and after 6 months of light use (4-5 times per week) the first two malfunctioned. What I mean is the screen became so faint you could hardly see it and putting in a new battery didn't help.  My current one I bought in July and so far everything is holding up. Knock on wood!  They are cheap .....so I guess you could look at them as a disposable tuner but you'd better have a back up cuz they break when you least expect it.
1,4,"I bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp (I play guitar).  She has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome.  I was hoping this tuner would clip on the top of the harp to make it easier for her.Unfortunately, it doesn't fit on top of our harp.  The tuner is rather small which is nice for transporting but the clip will not open wide enough for the top of the harp.  It does, however, clip into the sound hole okay.It tunes the harp fairly well.  I only had problems with the top 3-4 strings which I had to pluck a bit harder for the tuner to pick up.I also tried it on my acoustic guitar and it did the job perfectly.  (Clipped it to the top of the headstock)Tracking is very, very good for a tuner at this price.  I was able to play the strings, tune them, and watch the meter follow the note.  Display is very easy to read and lights up nicely.  I was tuning in a dim-lit room and was able to read it perfectly.  I'm sure it would be great on a dark stage.The only other drawback is that the display needs to be positioned within a certain range.  Otherwise it gets a big hard to read.  But positioning it is very simple since it swivels easily.4 out 5 only because of size (not fitting on harp as I hoped) and display legibility depending on angle (I had to reposition it maybe 2 times in order to tune the whole harp)."
1,5,"Easy to see, Easy to use, Easy to get used to.  The display is bright and very intuitive to the way we visualize sound, that is what makes it so useful.  You can't beat the price for such a great little tuner.  Amazon as usual makes ordering, paying and receiving a simple a and pleasant experience.  I will be buying one for every guitar case I own."
1,5,I bought this for my mandolin and was pleasantly surprised how awesome it a find this was. Easy to use and handy for ANY string instruments.Only thing i regret is not getting one sooner.
1,5,"There are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well. Before this I had been using tuner pro android app that also works well but I don't have it all the time.There is one big negative, it is absolutely useless outside in the sun or even shade. Can't even tell if it is on or off. Outside of that I am glad I picked the ""red"" version instead of the others."
1,4,"The tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode. The screen could be a little brighter. Otherwise, no complaints."
1,5,"I'm so glad I was introduced to this via my guitar coach years ago. It's cheap, yet works better than most tuners that require a plug in that end up costing around slightly more. It's been awhile since I've had it, and still have no complaints or issues with it. I wholeheartedly recommend this!"
1,5,this tuner is great best buy works so well I highly recommend this Tuner can't buy a better tuner for less money
0,3,"I've been using the snark for a year or so now, and I always have the suspicion that it's just telling me what I want to hear - that my guitar is in tune, when in fact, it's not.  The other day I had to go from standard tuning to DADGAD, and had about 1 minute to do so (plenty of time) but after the tuner said it was in tune, it was time to start playing and it was, well... noticeably out of tune.  After checking each string multiple times!  Very frustrating.  I guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy.  If you want something that usually puts you in the ballpark but may betray you when it really counts, then go with the Snark.  It's better than other clip-ons I've used, but still not cutting it in my opinion.  I play a Taylor 414ce.  A plus side is that you can buy a five-pack of batteries on amazon for 2 bucks - shipping and all.  You will need them sooner than you think :)"
1,5,"The traditional black box tuners are boring and slow.  This thing is super responsive to string selection just hopping on the new tone immediately, exact, easy to use, fun to look at.  There is a linkage arm that is not shown in the photo that makes it even better."
1,5,"I'll just say, newbie to ukulele, no idea how to tune it, instructions online say GCEA, I put this on the head, plucked each string, tuned the machine head until it said dead on, and that was it.  I keep this clipped to my ukulele standInstrument Stand for Violin, Ukulele and Other Small Instruments(see my reviews of it, it's so so, the stand), and just turn it on and tune the uke before I take it off the stand.  ONly time will tell how these little nickel watch battery style battery lasts, I find them a bear to buy, but time will tell.  Anyhow, I concur with the reviews on here, glad I listened to them, and for any brand new ukulele players out there, this is the one to get.  C ya"
1,4,"If you play a string instrument, this one is a must.  I have several and a Snark for each one.  Unfortunately, in the span of about two years, they've gone from about $6 (in bulk) to about double that.  It's a good product, but shop around wisely for the best price, and hint:  read the fine print, if they include a battery, you'll pay lots more.  I even found the batteries online about half the price than in a drug store. Five stars for performance, take away one for greed. And another comment in 2013.  I decided to buy 4 more, but went to another source which only charged ONE shipping price, not 4."
1,4,"I was shocked when I got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was. For the sake of letting you know its compatibility, I have used this to effectively tune an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, a mandolin, and a 4-string bass. That's a huge range for any tuner! I've had older versions of clip-on tuners and this one just works faster and better. Recommended for any application in which you may need a variety of ranges. The ones made for guitar have limited range, but are cheaper, but I would imagine they're just as accurate.I'm not a huge fan of the red color, it is really bulky and noticeable on all the instruments I've had, but I'm happy with the trade-off. I just wish there was a smaller, more discrete option or something in black or a more muted color."
1,5,"I've used electronic tuners for a long time.  Most of them that I've owned you have to plug into your instrument.  That means they don't tune with a microphone but only with an electronic signal directly from the instrument.  I bought a Korg GA-30 that was about the size of a credit card with a built in microphone to tune acoustic instruments about 8 or 10 years ago.  I used that Korg until getting the Snark.  The Korg was durable and fairly accurate but the LCD display wasn't lit making it tough to read in low light and the needle seemed to jump around sometimes for no good reason.  Still for the money the Korg was a good deal on a tuner with a microphone in it's day.Enter the Snark SN-2.  This Snark will tune about anything.  It will tune either by vibration clipped onto the headstock of a stringed instrument or don't clip it to the instrument and use the built in microphone.  Clip it to a music stand, clip it to anything and it still works when you use the built in microphone for a guitar, upright bass, violin, saxophone, trumpet or even a tympani.  Use the vibration setting for tuning an acoustic or electric guitar or ukulele or mandolin or banjo without interference from other sound sources.  It tunes about anything no matter the notes or key you want to tune your instrument to.  It senses the entire scale.The Snark SN-2 has a well lit, clean and bright display that is easy to read in bright light or total darkness.  The display pivots to any angle.  It is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock.  The battery seems to last a fairly long time, longer than the 9-Volt battery in my tuner pedal that burns through pricey 9 volt Duracells at the rate of about 1 per month.Long term durability seems to be a question to me due the small pivot on all the Snark clip-on tuners.  I've only been using mine for about 2 months now and while the pivot part seems sort of fragile I've had no issues at all yet and it still works good.  I don't think you should drop it very often.  So far I've dropped mine once with no damage.  Even if it did break, 10 Snarks are cheaper than the rack tuner I have and the Snark is just as accurate.While long term durability is undecided I can't complain at all about the versatility, accuracy, high visibility display or the low cost.  I really like mine and use it everyday on an electric bass or a ukulele or a guitar.  It really gets around and tunes them all.  The color is sort of a metallic red, almost Candy Apple Red.  I ordered spare batteries but haven't needed to change one yet.I'd buy it again and suggest one as a gift for any musician that doesn't have one.  I'm sure they'll use it often.  This tuner is a real good buy at a good price.  Spare CR2032 Lithium batteries are less expensive on Amazon, so I suggest ordering several with your tuner so you'll be prepared.I've never used the metronome feature other than to check it out.  It flashed a locked tempo but I really don't need that feature."
1,5,"I purchased this to use with my old Yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele.  It works great on both, very accurate and easy to use.  The swiveling head works very nicely and makes it easy to see at any angle.  It appears sturdy, and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument. I haven't used other tuners of this type, but this one works great and seems like a great value for the price."
1,5,"I like this tuner as much as my SN8. It's accurate, fast reading, and has the added feature of  acoustic mode if you need it,"
1,5,"I received my tuner yesterday very fast shipping,it looks great,  the price is right, but most of all it works wonderful, very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case."
1,5,"I bought it to tune my guitars and my banjo, it works good on all of them and is very accurate. I also used it to tune my uncle's mandolin for him because he couldn't find his tuner. Other than that theres not much else to say :P, I haven't used the metronome so I can't comment on that."
1,5,"So easy to use.  Just clip it on and ta-da!  The screen is very easy to see and tuning my banjo is a breeze with it.  Unfortunately, my dog thought it was a delicious toy and mauled it beyond recognition so I need to buy another one.  If your dog loves toys, keep this out of reach."
1,5,"I had used one of these at a guitar shop once while shopping for a new acoustic/electric. I was so used to the big klunky ones that you balance on your leg while trying to tune, I had no idea these even existed. After using it to tune 10 different prospects in a row, I decided to buy one on the spot (the tuner that is, it took another hour to decide on a guitar).It is very easy to use, the tuning via vibration is spectacular in a noisy environment. I like leaving it on the guitar while practicing to just make minor adjustments if there's a drop-D song, or just tweak something that goes out of tune.Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it stays out of the way."
1,5,"I first used the Snark when I borrowed a friends before a show, and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. He used it to tune his acoustic electric, and at first I thought it was working off of sound, but then I put it on the headstock of my unplugged electric, and it picked it up instantly, and tuned it perfectly. I couldn't beleive it. I had to have one. I ordered the one that is capable of both miced tuning, and vibration tuning, as well has having the tap beat metronome, and I am in love with it. It's SO sensitive, and so accurate, you can turn the mic off, and use it to tune your electric guitar in a VERY loud room, and it won't pick up ambient noises. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. I recommend this to ALL musicians. The mic feature would be useful on your music stand, or attached to your trumpet, tuba, saxophone, whatever... clamp it on, and play. Absolutely awesome."
0,3,Works fine. It is of course difficult to tune when other's are playing around you. I found the mic tuner isn't as accurate. Also the rubber pad on the clamp falls off easily. It is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too.
1,5,I am impressed at the thought that was put into the design of this product; I bought one for my daughter and one for me; great deal for a great product!
1,5,"This is the second one i buy and i love it, is small, fast and accurate , best of all, you don't need to have the volume knob open for tuning, i bough this one as a birthday present for a friend and i know is inexpensive, but it feel quality and does it job perfectly , my friend love it above all the other gift, it is a everyday use tool for a musician."
1,5,"I was using my iPhone and line 6 input but having to plug in can be a drag when you're no where near your gear. But hands down this is the most accurate, easy to use, and most portable tuner ever. I use it for all mu guitars, bass, mandolin, banjo, etc. I bought two more, you will love this tuner."
1,4,"This is a great tuner, I just wish that the clamp was a little bit wider since I mostly have classical guitars and the width of the headstocks can be a little thicker than steel string acoustics or electric guitars.  Other than that, works great I like using it."
1,4,Very nice clip on tuner for the price.I actually got this as a gift for a friend and they seem to really like it.
0,3,"This tuner is amazing, even more so considering the price. It's chromatic, so it will tune anything! I tune electric and acoustic guitars, bass, ukulele and mandolin with it! I've bought three for gifts... It's great.Sooooo, everything I said initially is still true... It's a fantastic little tuner... BUT I've broken two of them. (Where the clip attaches to the tuner - as in a multitude of other reviews...)This tuner *is* amazing... But fragile!"
1,5,I wanted the version of this device with the built-in microphone to be able to check my singing accuracy as well as to tune my guitar. Maybe I should just change the guitar pitch to my off-pitch singing and I could finally achieve perfect harmony! I like everything about it especially (I think) it's ability to turn itself off after use if you forget to do so and save the battery life. A well designed device.
1,5,"Love the Snark SN-2. Works well on my bass, and does a beautiful job on both acoustic and electric guitars. Tight tuning and easily used. Very good product overall, not to mention the reasonable price.Buy it."
1,5,It does what a guitar tuner should do.It simply clips onto the headstock of the guitar and easily shows you where your string is in reference to standard tuning.I do have an equally good tuner by monoprice that's about half price. Better deal if you don't just buy one and have to pay single shipping.
1,4,"Easy to use, portable, cheap.  Not exact in tuning, might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican.  For most of us this is more than adequate."
1,5,"I buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases. Bright display, easy to use, works well and cheap. I have bought several of their models. I particularly like the fact that when the battery is dying the display becomes darker but the unit still works correctly. I hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries. Had a problem with the pivot joint breaking on one of the older models, but it was replaced without a peep by the manufacturer. Newer models seem a bit beefier."
1,5,"I wrote a review for the SN-1 which is essentailly the same tuner except this one also has a mic.  Here is my other review:I own a few tuners, including a Boss Tu-70.  Recently I purchased and reviewed the new GoGo TT-1 clip on tuner. I never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my Boss.  The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use.  But now I have to say, I think the Snark is a little better. I bought the SN-1 and the SN-2 because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate.  The other great thing is they are chormatic, so besides being a great tuner, you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard. The display is very easy to read...better than the GoGo (although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine).  I love the colors and the matte finish too.  The rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners. The rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too, I had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my GoGo.  The Snark is less than half the price of my GoGo and out performs it...it's a no brainer."
1,5,I highly recommend these tuners.  They are the best I have found for Fiddle and Mandolin.  They also work well with acoustical guitar.
1,5,"so this was my first real tuner, its very simple to use. great tool and has two different modes which is cool."
1,4,"Great precise tuning with the SN-2 versus the other Snark versions. I would only go with the SN-2. But...like all the Snarks, they are delicate where the head attaches at the ball joint. Treat it gently and find a hardshell plastic case in which to keep it and transport it or it will get smashed and break apart."
1,5,"Wow. Very cool gadget, and well executed. This review is based on using it with a number of acoustic and electric guitars with various headstocks. I have not tried it with other stringed or non-stringed instruments.The thing is quick and accurate. The display colors are bright and easy to read. It does not have to do much guessing at what note you are playing. (In fact, if you play a chord, it will usually guess the root note of the chord.) It clips on easily and firmly. It is very sensitive. I find that I have a habit of plucking the string frequently and not taking advantage of the sustain when tuning due to other tuners that needed stronger input to work. But I can pluck a string and slowly wind the string into tune, usually without having to pluck it again before I have it right.As an added bonus in my case, the color happens to be a great match for an Epiphone SG G-400 in Cherry Red."
1,5,"For 10 bucks it's a great piece. Works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass. Battery IS included, but it is very small and almost lost it."
1,4,"This is my second, after breaking the last one's neck! The plastic socket around the ball & socket joint couldn't take the stress in the gig bag... I'll keep this one by the music stand,"
1,5,"I have several tuners. one is an inline tuner, one built into my amp....etc... This is my favorite go to tuner. It's fast and accurate. Every one in my band uses this tuner. It works for guitar and bass. It's easy to read and dead on...."
1,4,"I really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use. However, it broke not too long after I bought it. One of the connections broke, that is. I think they might have made it a little more durable since then. Moreover, I sent it in and they replaced it, so that was cool. It would be nice, though, not to have had to do that."
1,5,It works.  It is cheap.  It does the job well.  A review mentioned it didn't come with batteries.  Mine came with batteries. I highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews.
0,3,"It works really well for tunings other than standard EADGBE.  I am still trying to get it tuning in standard, but so far it's pretty accurate.  I know it can do standard tuning, i just can't figure it out."
1,5,Great little tuner.  Easy to work with and also easy to find.  The price is also right and I recommend.
1,5,"BOUGHT THIS SN-2 SNARK TUNER AFTER I BOUGHT A UKULELE SNARK FOR MY LITTLE NIECE  I WAS SO PLEASED AT THE EASE OF ITS USE.  I MAINLY WANTED THIS FOR MY BANJO BUT I ALSO NOW USE IT ON MY BARITONE UKULELE, A GUITAR AND IF I EVER GET INTO THE SPIRIT I MIGHT JUST TRY IT ON THE OLD MANDOLIN THAT MY GREAT AUNT LEFT ME. . THE SNARK IS SMALL, VERY LIGHT WEIGHT, AND SUPER EASY TO USE.  IT'S A VERY WORTHWHILE PURCHASE."
0,3,"I haven't read a lot of comments about these guys breaking, so maybe my wife and I are just ham-handed Shrek wannabes, but we have busted two of these little gizmos. They are basically made of a clip that attaches to your instrument, a round frisbee shaped tuner, and an arm that connects the two. The arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into. She and I have each busted one, doing something mundane like putting it into a case or setting down a guitar on a carpeted floor.While the tuner works well otherwise (except the low E string on a bass which can be problematic), and the things don't cost very much, it's a shame we keep busting them. I do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable. Just be extra careful handling them."
1,5,"We've been only using it for two days, and so far so good. I cannot say anything about durability for now, but I'll update this review if it breaks.====One of my kids has been borrowing my trusty old BOSS TU-12 chromatic tuner forever for her violin, and I finally bought this for her.There are many clip-on tuners, but I liked the following about this tuner:1. LCD mimicing an analog needle so you know how much you're off (as opposed to just flat or sharp).2. You can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic. Most of the time you want to use vibration sensor anyway, but a mic sometimes comes in handy.3. Can set different pitch than A=440.4. Not expensive (was less than [...]$ including shipping).Upon delivery I tried it on my guitars (both acoustic and electric) using vibration sensor before giving it to my kid, and was impressed.It is quick to track the note even for low E. It's not picky about where on the peghead it is clipped on. No stress whatsoever, indeed it's just as quick and smooth as my BOSS. LCD is bright and clear, and needle-ish display works as expected.It worked very well on violin too. And I saw kids singing to internal mic to check the pitch of their voices just for fun.And a note about the looks. From the picture I expected it to be ugly, but actually it was not that bad. It's tiny and doesn't look like a Fisher-Price product.====First update, Nov 24 2010: I've tried it on an electric bass (4 string), and it worked equally well. Still 5 stars.====Second update, Oct 20 2011: It's still working happily for my daughter, and I bought a second unit for myself. Fantastic product."
1,5,"I have 7 of these bad boy tuners and I love them. I keep them clipped to each of my guitar heads so they are always ready if I need a quick tuning to that guitar...Good quality, accurate and not expensive...Highly recommended and 5 Stars."
0,2,Tuner works great. Both by vibration and mic.Only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak. Mine broke off... not even a year old.
1,5,"This chromatic clip-on tuner is the best of the best.  One cannot go without having one for the price.  I've tuned violins, guitars and ukelele's with it.  This is an electronic gadget you just cannot do without.  You can use the vibration setting to tune with a room full of people talking or playing other instruments.  If you have it on the MIC than you can tune many instruments all at once if you wish.This little instrument tuner does everything.  FOR THE COST ...YOU JUST CANNOT BE WITHOUT ONE."
1,5,These are great!  They're small.  Light weight.  Easy to read.  Accurate.  Inexpensive.  This one offers an additional feature:  Tap Tempo Metronome
1,5,"I bought this Snark tuner for my daughter to use to tuner her classical guitar and her guitarlele.  I've been using a blue Snark tuner for a couple of years and have loved it.  I thought she needed a Snark of her own and it works like a charm.  I like the chromatic aspect of it because you can tune your strings to any pitch other than concert pitch.  Sometimes we like to go lower, and sometime a whole or half-step higher.It's beautiful to look at, clips on the head of the instrument with soft rubber feet, and truly does an excellent job of tuning.  I teach classical guitar and have found this tuner to be one I go to the most, and I have a lot of different tuners.  I rarely use any of my other tuners anymore, relying mostly on the Snarks that I have.  It uses a CR2032 button battery which is inexpensive and lasts a long time.  I use my Snark at least 4 times a day either tuning my instruments or my students.  What I really love about these types of tuners is that you can talk while tuning since it feels the vibrations of the string instead of listening to it.  It will tune practically anywhere  - loud rooms, etc...and tune accurately."
1,5,"Extreamly easy to use, you can tune any instrumet witn this.  The display is bright and clear, easy to see in the dark.  You can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration; the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument.  The price couldn't be better, I just can't believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists."
1,5,I have been in need of a tuner for far too long.  I was turned on to this and I was truly blown away.  The tuner is very accurate and compact.  I leave it on my guitar all the time.  The clamp is strong enough that it will stay put.
1,5,My old one lasted a long while and it still works. Just wanted another one. These tuners are just awesome!
0,3,"it works well and gets the job done but the battery dies way to quickly, other than that its has a cool clip that lets it be placed anywhere"
1,5,"I have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners.  They all work fine for me.  However, the Snark SN-2 just has the edge. It's performance, look and feel are great!  The added features are also a plus.  I use the Snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar.  It's my go to for chromatic tuner.  Highly recommend this."
1,5,"There really does not need to be a 10 page review that breaks this thing down to every tedious detail. This is a tuner that clips on the headstock of the guitar, and tunes it in perfect pitch. For a 10 dollar bill it is impossible to beat. These are a staple on every single guitar in our band! Bright and easy to read!"
1,5,"This is without a doubt the best guitar tuner I have ever used.  I have been playing for years and have owned many tuners, this one is the best and I purchased it at a better price than it was offered at my local music store."
0,2,"Stopped working all by itself. Fresh battery didn't help.Fortunately, I've another, plus a Korg and an two Intellitouch. (I've 2 fiddles and 3 guitars)The Intellitouch is simply ""champion!""."
1,5,"I own several of the Snark tuners, but the Snark SN-2 is my personal favorite.  It settles extremely fast, and works with a wide array of instruments and couldn't be simpler.  Just clip it to your instrument and strum or play a note and, in an instant, there it is.  The display is bright and easy to read, and the graph has a lot of resolution.  The SN-2 senses frequency through vibration, but it also has a selectable microphone pickup.  It is transposable, and it offers a metronome feature.  The SN-2 is finished with a rubbery texture and is a beautiful &#34;electric red&#34; color."
1,5,Tunes by sound or vibration thats all i use it for the vibration mode is really nice. buy one its convenient
1,5,I love this tuner. It measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone. I find it really useful when trying to figure out what chord I want to play next. I can sing the note into it and then I know which chord I want to play next!
1,4,"I've played guitars for over 40 years, and I've owned or used many, many tuners - stompbox, rack-mount, etc.  This is a great tuner. I bought a clip-on tuner about 10 years ago when they were first becoming popular.  It was ok - fairly accurate, very convenient, but it's sensitivity would make it difficult to tune the low E.  This Snark is much better.  I compared it to my Boss TU-2 (which is the standard stompbox tuner of gigging musicians), and it's just about as accurate.  The fact that it's chromatic means you can tune to any note, which is useful for non-standard tunings. It even has a built-in mic for situations where you can't clip it on (say, for a lap-steel guitar).  The head swivels to just about any position, and its sensitivity allows you to tune in live situations when other instruments are playing.  The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is that because of its curved ""arm"" it's a little awkward to pack for traveling - if you were to cram it into a space and there was some pressure on it I could see the arm possibly breaking off from the spring part. So, to me, outside of that (and the fact that it only comes in red so far), it's perfect."
1,5,"I'm a big believer and long time user of many different types of visual tuning devices.  I play guitar, mandolin and ukelele.  And this inexpensive tuner is the best one I've ever used by a long way.  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  It has an option to use either an internal vibration sensor via the clip or a built in microphone.  The dial is easily readable and adjustable to a wide range of viewing angles.  And it has the fastest and best response of any tuner I've ever used.  It doesn't require a loud volume to ""hear"" the tone.  Finally, it doesn't seem to wander around trying to attune itself to the note you just played, but it does instantly sense very fine differences in that tone.  If I detune by about 1/16th of a turn on my tuning machine (an difference I can't hear with my own ear), this device detects it immediately.  All in all, this thing is a whole step up in accuracy in tuning."
1,5,"Got this for a 15 year old learning guitar.  They thought the guitar was fine before the tuner.  My, how things change when you can see what is really going on.  Recommended."
1,5,"This tuner is way better than my earlier tunners which relied on either sound to their microphone, or direct plug in for electric instruments.  This has the microphone feature, but is better used with the clip on vibration mode.  Just clip it on to your guitar head, and hit the string.  A multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat.  Easy to use."
1,5,It is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments. It works better than my piano. I can trust that I will be in tune.
1,5,"OK, it's a tuner.  But.....it is dead balls-on accurate, quick tuning and easy to read even in daylight.  Great for gigs in that you can tune and re-tune during performances with fast, fast accuracy.  I own 5 or 6 of them, one for each guitar, and I highly recommend them over ANYTHING else."
1,5,Works well - but be careful when swivelling the display as it can easily break one of the four tabs it clips into.
1,5,"Handy, well made, small, easy to see.  Great for guitar, fiddle, mandolin, dobro, and other instruments that it can clamp to."
1,5,"This tuner is cool. It picks up even the lightest vibrations, i/e: I can hit the high e on my acoustic and it will register the tone until it pretty much dies out. I also like the capo tuning feature. You put a capo on the 3rd and tell the tuner to flatten 3x. I highly recommend this tuner."
1,5,"I tune by ear and the old fashion way, but this is so much better and locks in the note so you can really tell what you are doing.  Great tuner."
1,5,"The design of this product is innovative and excellent.  I haven't used it for as long as I would generally like before writing Amazon reviews of purchased items, and so cannot testify to its reliability, but suffice to say that, for the price, it would be hard to beat.The display is very clear, and the ability to clip to your headstock while tuning is marvelous.  I wonder how I ever lived without it before.For live gigs playing electric, I would prefer a floor tuner running through a pedal board with a patch cable, as noisy environments probably wouldn't be ideal for this tuner.  This is more for your parlor acoustic setup."
1,5,"love it! fast, easy to use, effective, small enough to carry around and wonderfully accurate. a must have for any musician"
1,5,"I bought this tuner because I am learning to play guitar and want to keep my guitar in tuneGreat little tuner that looks good and works even better It works really well, but not perfectly"
1,5,"Like it better than the other tuner I bought, this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again."
1,5,"This little tuner is so easy to use and see...I bought two more as presents. The price point was just unbeatable for such a stellar performing tuner. If you don't have a tuner or are looking for a new one, you NEED this one. A+++"
1,5,"Easy, accurate and, best of all, it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing. I've tried other brands and they don't swivel  correctly. And it's red! Very cool."
1,4,"I really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky. Very obvious. Calls a lot of attention to itself, all GIANT and red.Still, I can't fault it's tuning prowess. It's quick and pretty on the money. It replaced my Roland Boss Tu-12h.Well more handy for tuning my sweet La Patrie nylon strung &#34;Motif&#34;Would buy again,  but I'd really prefer a more subdued  color."
1,5,"I had the SN1 Guitar Tuner, this one the SN2 is actually for all instruments if I'm not mistaken and it works great. Never fails. I love the red, the swivel head, the green.red lights when tuning. Just remember to take it off the headstock when youre done using it"
1,5,i think this is the best tuner i love it it really works and its really easy to use it
1,5,"I love these things. I have purchased several Snarks of all different types. Fast, accurate and a joy to use. My young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one. All Snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner. The SN-2 also has a built in mic for use with any instrument, such as trumpet, sax, clarinet, etc. I have other, more expensive clip on tuners, but the Snark is by far my favorite."
0,3,"UPDATE: 15 July 2013I still really love how these assist in quick tuning, but MAN, are they FLIMSY.All of my other musician friends- who also LOVE this tuner's ability to grab the right pitch- also have employed copious amounts of super glue to re-attach the neck and clip to the body of the tuner.So, in short, this is a mixed bag. I would rate the abilities of the actual tuner at somewhere over 6 stars- EASILY my favorite ever in this capacity... combined with the absolutely DEPLORABLE build quality of the clip itself.Sigh.It's such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends... only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer.If SNARK fixes the problem, I would instantly bring the rating back up to my original 5 star rating... but until then...and I LOVE this tuner... 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.Boo.(ORIGINAL REVIEW)I have had similar tuners in the past... and by similar, I mean clip on...Nearly every other tuner I have had has not maintained a reading, which translated into what felt like a game of keep away, where I was the frustrated kid in the middle who could never quite catch the pitch.I am willing to bet that lots of folks have had this experience with many tuners. Not only that, but many of these tuners run upwards of twenty bucks, if not more.So I was skeptical. But so many high reviews couldn't be wrong, and for the price I figured it was a fairly risk free gamble.Really glad I tried it out!The screen is clear and easy to read, and the pitch indicator holds steady in one spot. No more chasing pitch for me!Haven't needed to use the vibration/ mic option yet, but I am sure that will come in handy at some point.Planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well.Definitely recommended!"
1,5,I got this after seeing many of my church friends using them.  I got this one so I could use it to tune my guitars a ukulele and a violin.  It does all of them well.  I'm going to buy a couple more as gifts.
1,5,This is a great tuner. High quality construction. The tuning is accurate. The controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read. It is far superior to a Fishman tuner that I bought previously. The Fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate. These tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing.
1,5,I can't believe what you can get for the price on this one.  Tunes all my instruments fast and easy.  The display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever.
1,5,"I love this little device:The colors of the display are a nice touch (red on the left hand side and green on the right).The color of the device.The interface is great and the clip works well.It's very accurate and I love how its chromatic function and the fact that it has a very large letter for the chord (versus being hard to read).A very attractive price.  I bought two.  It would be easy to have one for travelling purposes and to leave one at home just in case you lose it.  And it's so cheap, it wouldn't matter if you lost it."
1,5,This device has really help me. I am new at trying to learn. I have a long way to go.
1,5,"I must have had over 20 tuners in the last few decades, and the Snark is by far my favorite.  I change out altered capos every few songs, so I have to tweak the tuning many times each gig, and this has made it much easier, even in noisy clubs with poor lighting."
1,5,use it on my mandobanjoacoustic guitarupright bassreg bassdon't leave home without itbut take and extra button battery
1,5,I am a novice guitar player.  Arrived in 2 days!  Does exactly what it SAYS it'll do...right out of the box!  Correctly tuned this VERY OLD guitar for the first time in YEARS!
1,5,Exactly what I expected. A quality tuner for a low price. Very durable and gets the job done. Great buy!
1,5,These sell for about $20-25 in the real world.  I paid a bit over $12 and it was an Amazon Prime purchase too.  The display is better than most I've used (dating back 30 years).  The best thing is that I can pass this around to band members quickly when they have a need too.
1,5,"My mother ""plays"" the guitar (I am a banjo/mandolin player), and the Snark SN-2 came in the mail while I was gone for 5 days.  She opened it up, got curious and tried it out on her guitar that prolly hasn't been in tune since... I dunno... and she LOVED it!  lulz  This little thing really is my absolute favorite instrument accessory, both a vibrational and an internal mic pickup.  I was using my old Korg chromatic for those times I wanted to see if I was singing the correct note... and was actually pleasantly surprised that the Snark SN-2 had a mic.  One less accessory in the little bag now.  :DI am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function, however... its neat as you can play without the TICK TOCK distraction and still look up once in awhile to see if you are on beat, but as an actual instructional tool for keeping tempo... mmm, I would still highly recommend using an audible metronome.Side note, if you have friends/family that play a string instrument, be aware your Snark SN-2 *WILL* be making the rounds."
1,5,This is the second clip on tuner I have bought. This is much better than the other brand I have. It's easy to use and see. The colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite. The built in tap metronome is a cool idea. If you're shopping for a tuner give this a try. At less than $13 it's a fantastic buy
1,5,"This is a very versatile tuner!  I use it all the time to check my instruments, and keep things sounding good.  Highly recommend this product."
1,5,"This tuner tunes my guitars very well, it tunes them perfectly, and works well tuning bass guitar, very easy to use, very visible screen when tuning, clamps on nicely, and the red color is very beautiful you could say, all in all very good tuner."
1,5,I like cool gadgets - and this is no exception. The red color is a metallic color - and I totally dig it. The display is nice and bright as well. Super accurate tuning. Well worth it for the price.
1,5,Much better than similarly priced products out there for tuning.  I can't recommend this enough and the battery last a LONG time!  I haven't had to change mine in almost two years since I've had it!  Just a great overall tuner.
1,5,"I purchased this item sometime in August, and think it's pretty good. I have not had any problems with it; Not that I can remember. Pretty simple, it does what it's supposed to do."
1,4,"Price is Right for entry level. Using as a backup or on my mixer when using my higher quality short stand during recordings. The Mic mount was a PLUS, using it for one Karaoke ""Cheap Mics"" It is just pop-riveted on so a Bit LOOSE, but could improve with a little 2 part epoxy. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars! Still for the money a great buy..."
1,4,This tabletop Mic Stand works. Well designed and made from descent enough materials. I would buy again when I'm ready to replace the one I have or add to it.
1,4,"This is a very well built stand, even with its slim design, which also comes with a nice carrying case. Very good for light, portable set ups. Also holds a big mic, if you position the legs right; completely open with the mic parallel to a leg. That said, do it wrong and plunk. Will not likely stand up to a gusty wind, so use it indoors only. Paid $7.99 for it. Would give it 5 stars, but I know user error, will cause a less careful person, to crash some mics. Good for kick drum and cab mics, by the way, anchor it down with a sand bag, if using it for this purpose."
1,5,great for carrying with you.  works as it should.  good price.  I would recommend it if you need a table top mic stand or one just off the floor about a foot.
1,4,"It was my fault not to check out it's measurements before purchase. But it's not the reason why I drop by one star. The reason is it's not designed properly.Since people stand and sing, this extendable table mic stand is still too short for people taller than 6 feet. I'm 5'11'' I can barely reach the microphone when I stand still.Also, it's way to tall if you want to sit and use it as a PC mic.As a result, I feel I'm  either too tall or too short...Build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten. Overall a four stars product IMO."
1,5,This was so inexpensive I couldn't pass it up.I needed a short stand to mic kick drums for recordings and this fit the bill exactly.Folds up quite small and comes with the carrying bag. I just toss it in my gig bag and I'm always ready.[...]
1,5,"I have a Blue Snowball mic and the stand that comes with that thing is entirely too short for my needs so I set out to find a desk-stand for my microphone that I could use for podcasting and video work. Here are my pros and cons.Pros1. It's about twice as tall as the stock stand that comes with the Snowball. This may be too tall for some (with the mic put in, it stands as tall as my 17&#34; ASUS G75VW) but I have a raised desk so this fits right up to my mouth.2. The Snowball screws right in (unscrew the holder thing that comes on there, screw the snowball in, win).3. After some research, I found that this will fit pretty much any mic. Cool.4. It seems sturdy and well built.Cons1. The legs make this thing very, very wide. It's about 2/3 the size of my keyboard which means it takes up a lot of space.2. The mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird. Not bad, just weird.Overall, this is highly recommended for a desk stand. It seems to be able to fit just about any mic and it's perfect for video voice overs and podcasts."
1,5,"It is so small that it cannot hold all mics. If you have a big lopsided kick drum mic  with a skinny neck and akward COG(AKG D112), this stand will not be able to hold it up. It can however hold up the Audix D6 and it can hold an SM 57 up to a guitar cab if its the right height. I love this because it has allowed me to mic things in really really tight spaces. I would never have had room to use full sized instrument mic stands in some of the tiny stages I have seen this summer. This thing takes up very little real estate, I have put this thing in the pocket of my jeans before!"
1,4,"I use this short stand for mic'ing my guitar amp cabinet. It is pretty small and on the edge of ""light duty"" but I wouldn't call it cheap or crappy. The adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably. I don't use it for gig'ing so it isn't getting beat on but it seems to be a pretty good mic stand and the price was great. I also purchased a ""musician's gear""  [ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018TC7BW/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title ]similar mic stand which was a few dollars more, I think I prefer the musician's gear unit becuase it's a bit beefier than this one but I still like this stand and it was a great value. This unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some. Both are perfect for home recording and practice studios, likely even hold up to some gig'ing."
1,5,I you are looking for a great desk or amp mic stand . This is it. Tripod legs are stable and also adjusts up and down to about 15 inches or so.It even comes with a case with two zippered sections. One for the stand and and one for a mic. There is also amic holder. What a find. I will probably get another.......
1,5,"Works great. It's lightweight but VERY stable, even with a heavy bass drum mic.A great bargain for a very sturdy, useful product."
1,4,Worked out of the package and was cheap. Longevity yet to be seen. It is short but if that is want you need it will do the job. Great match for your bedroom amp.
1,4,"I much prefer curly cable as they keep the slack up off the floor and help prevent nasty little tumbles and equipment spills due to general clumsiness. These cables are no different. They may not be the nicest looking cables ever, but for this price you can't shake a stick at it.The connectors are injection molded so theres no easy unscrew and re-solder when the time comes, but hey for a budget curly cable I am not complaining. I'll just nip the ends off if I need to replace them later. The cable seems to be of good quality; I'm guessing it's about 24 gauge wire and has a nice bounciness to it. I have not yet noticed any degradation of tone so it's probably fairly well-shielded. With the right-angled jack on one end it ensures a low profile so I don't easily kick the cable out of the pedal and will probably help it last longer with the reduced cable strain on that end. That's more than I thought I had to say about a cheap, but good, cable."
1,5,"I was afraid poor quality would come with the low price, but I did an AB comparison with one of my expensive oxygen free, yada, cables and I could not tell a difference.  I was playing an American made guitar through an American made tube amp so this was a legit sound test.  I'm sure the plastic on the ends of the plugs will not last as long as a more expensive cable...but who cares...buy a new one!  Love the coil, love the price."
1,5,"this a great cable for practicing at home. Coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles. This product measures approx. 28"" coiled, plug end to plug end. Thus it is pretty short, even when stretched out. For me, it is the perfect length for at-home use, especially when using two (amp --> pedal board --> guitar).not sure why it isnt available for order on Amazon anymore ... I just ordered mine two weeks ago."
1,5,"I bought this to run from my peddle board to my guitar.Since the peddle board is right in front of me, the coiled nature of the cord keeps me from getting tangled up.What surprised me was how it improved the sound? I hadn't thought that a cable would do this but I've since been told that I'm not the only player that has noticed this phenomena. It's beyond me how this works but I can hear the difference so, I'm changing over to all coiled cords."
1,4,I really like this cable! Maybe it's not top quality but it feels solid to me and works just fine. I keep it attached to my little practice amp and play a few feet away. It probably stretches 10-12 feet if you really need it too. What I really like is that it's compact and I don't have cables laying all over the floor.Overall it's a solid cable for practice. I'll buy more.
1,5,"I bought this cable long with my epiphone les paul special II and the Fender Mini Tone Master thinking that either one did not come with a cable. The epiphone came with a cable which ceased functioning after a couple days. The curly cable has fared much better. No problems, works great and doesn't tangle so it stores easily too.Great as a primary or backup cable. Buy one, it's cheap!"
1,5,"these are great for people when practicing they are cheap and sound good.they are almost as good sounding as monster cables but just a little bit worse. i actually dont use monster cables anymore i like this one more and for the price how can i complain.a tip for people new to guitar, cable that have a angled jack are best for when you sit and play because when you plug a straight one into the guitar jack and you sit you actually bend the wire, and what happens is the wire actually have to be bent in a certain way to work and eventually wont work at all,just like headphone wires.but when you plugged the angled one into the guitar its all good and no problems."
1,4,"GOOD POINTS: [1] This cable, unlike many other coiled cables I've tried, does NOT add noise when it's moved. I swung it about quite a bit while playing through it, and it made no noise at all. [2] It also has good plugs in that the indentation on the male plug provides a generous gap, making it easy for the female jack to connect to the male end. As a result, the cable does not slip out TOO easily; the connection between jack and plug is quite secure. BAD POINTS: [1] The package it comes in says it's a 20-foot cable. Not even close! Holding it up by one end, with the other end simply dangling (i.e., not plugged into anything), I saw that it measures 3 feet (again, that's when it's not stretched); when not stretched at all, it measures just 3 feet. Of course, this would not result in 20 feet when it's stretched. Sure enough, when I plugged it into an amp, I could COMFORTABLY stretch it to only about 6.5 feet. This might not bother you; it doesn't bother me since I didn't want the extra cable length. But if you need anything like a 20-foot cable, you're going to have to get something else. [2] Finally, a minor point: If you're using this on a guitar with a Strat-style jack, this cable will be a bit---but only a bit---more difficult than most cables to unplug from the guitar, no matter which end you plug into your guitar, because there's not much to grip when unplugging. Of course, if you pull on the cable itself, instead of one of the ends, you'll ruin it in no time. Overall, I am quite happy with this cable and would buy more, since I don't need more than the length it has, and since it makes no noise."
1,5,i use this cable to run between my pedal board and amp at rehearsals in a small space.  i use another one to connect the wireless mic receiver to the p.a.  the box says they are 20' and maybe there is 20' of wire but the stretch on them is maybe 5-8'.
1,4,"works as described on the ipad. for the price id expect a more durable product.its all plastic, but no moving parts to concern yourself with so it should hold up fairly well."
0,3,"Thank goodness Amazon doesn't sell this gadget for the forty-dollar retail price tag.I just got mine today and tried it out. The sound quality complaints are no joke. There is a constant hiss and any slight movement of the iRig or iPhone while playing will create a loud static noise. Don't know if a better quality jack on the iRig would've solved this problem or not.But if you're willing to tweak with the input and output line levels as well as your speaker or headphone volume settings, you may find a happy medium that you can live with.Still, the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool. If I find the need to really use one of these I'll probably spring for something that plugs into the iPhone dock connector. Until then this'll be a fun toy to play with.March 29, 2012 - Just a quick addendum to my initial review. I've since discovered the noise filter in the AmpliTube iPhone app, and wow, what a difference! It sounds much, much better now. No more hiss, no more static."
0,1,"...what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss? My guitar I guess, but who cares? I honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else.A question to AMAZON: Companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon shouldn't be prosecuted?P.S.I think it is ""too polluting"" for 'low cost' items to waste again in paper box, transportation, restocking work, refund work and so on. This is why 99% of the time I do not ask for my money back / BUT / sell this lemon on Amazon, online with other websites,  and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith (while testing nobody in iRig noticed the overwhelming  hisssssssing?) well that is beyond me!"
1,4,Works perfectly with iphone and ipad.  The app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed.  My only complaint is that the product itself seems incredibly empty and fragile since there is no weight to it.  But it hasn't broke yet and it might never break.  Works perfectly with ear buds with mic/controller.  Great idea!
0,2,"No matter how many times I hard reset my 3Gs, no success. There is no problem with my jack, and the phone is in pristine condition -- no problems until now. There is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work, but that's about it. I registered my Amplitude app, and followed all of the instructions on the box. I tested the iRig with an iPhone 4 and was able to get it operating.I am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend's iPhone 4. But for my purposes with a 3Gs, it is a brick. If anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation, I will re-rate the product."
1,5,"If you own an iphone/ipod touch and play guitar or bass you need this one.Was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this.The sound is incredible.Buy it, seriously."
0,3,"I was very disappointed when I tried this thing. I bought it so that I could play along the songs that I have on my Ipod but the guitar sounds really distorted (don't thing I haven't tried changing the settings on the effects/amps). Also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables. If you want to record what you play, you're probably better off saving some money and buying the Boss recorder or something like that. Being able to slow the songs down is somewhat useful but forget about playing along to it, it sounds so horrible is unbearable.Update: July 8, 2012. Against my better judgement I brought the Slash Amplitube app just to satisfy my curiosity and let me tell you is much much better. I guess the tittle of this review stands, the free app sucks but if you pay for it it'll be actually useful. I added two stars to the product."
1,5,one of my fav toys
1,5,"I bought this because I had a new baby at home and this allowed me to practice without rocking disturbing her. It's affordable, and does the same thing as more expensive adapters"
0,2,"This is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iPhone or iPad. But if you want to use it for any recording at all, even demos, I strongly recommend going for the iRigHD. The HD sounds waaaaaay better, and the build quality is great. This guy, not so much. There was always a bit of noise with my old iRig, and it seemed to get worse over time. It also felt kinda fragile and chinsy. If you look, you can usually find the HD somewhere for $80; a $50 difference is significant, but the jump in quality (and likely longevity of the product) is definitely worth it. I upgraded and would absolutely do it again."
1,4,"I got the irig thinking i'd use it for performance, but he app leaves somthing to be desired.  I had a very hard time fining a tone I could live with, plus, once you add any of the virtual pedals, the feedback was rediculous."
1,5,"I've used 4 different brands of clip-on tuners to tune my Classical guitars and electric basses, but this tuner is the most accurate. It captures the note immediately without errors, whether the low E on an electric bass guitar or the high E on my classical guitar. It is fast enough to use real time during intonation practice/training on fretless bass. It works flawlessly on solid body and acoustic instruments. Takes a little getting used to but simply, if the rings spin clockwise, the note is sharp; if the rings spin counterclockwise the note is flat.  If you can afford it, the Peterson is the best clip-on tuner out there."
1,4,"Sat on my Snark - Good tuner but takes some patience. No quick tuning, but great for exact tuning if you are recording etc. Would probably buy again, however will also get another Snark - much easier for quick stage / sight tuning"
1,4,"This is my first strobe tuner.  So far it has been wonderful for intonation/initial setups.  It may be a little bit of overkill for average string tuning but one thing is for sure; it is accurate!  The only thing I don't like is that the housing feels ""cheap.""  Like plasticy cheap.  It was packaged in an attractive tin (which is not good for fitting in the guitar case) and I wouldn't take it on the road but it most definitely will be on my bench as the go-to tuner.It is easy to use, though the precision requires very gentle turns of your tuner.UPDATE:The battery life is short as noted by another reviewer. Since I only use it for initial setups and intonations I remove the battery when I place it back in its tin. There's a little storage slot for an extra battery in the the case which is useful."
1,5,"I really like this tuner.  it works very well.  once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner (ie., the moving black squares to no longer move),  then tuning is a simple and accurate thing.  it works great on all of my guitars, acoustic and electric.  comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it.  it cause a few bucks, but I think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons, that it is worth it."
0,3,"As my reviews demonstrate, I'm a sucker for a new tuner.  Peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners. I'd even tried one, once, but decided it wasn't the sort of thing to be carrying around to jams.  So, when I saw that Peterson had introduced a clip on tuner, I couldn't help but salivate.""Awkward"" is a relative term, but I don't feel it's a disservice to use it here.  The typical clip-on tuner has an LCD ""needle"". When the needle is dead center, the string is tuner.  If it's short of center, the string is flat.  If it's past center, the string is sharp.  The SC-1 has two sets of rings that appear to rotate, analogous to what a strobe might look like.  A string is in tune when the rings stop rotating.  I found that with the way the sound of strings decays, it's difficult to get the rings to stop spinning, even in the SC-1's sustain mode.  (I've already returned the tuner.  Otherwise, I just realized, it would have been a big help to have done a short video of tuning a guitar with the SC-1 and with a Zoid or Intelli.)The SC-1 also boasts a ""sweetened"" mode for tuning guitars.  However, when  I tuned my lounging-at-home guitar this way, I found the needle was dead center on every string on my Intelli tuner. (For those who've read my other reviews, my preferred Zoid was in the case with my favorite guitar.)It may well be, and others may report, that the SC-1's feature set make it ideal for other situations.  However, if you main purpose is to keep a guitar in tune, then, with the SC-1 costing more than THREE ZoidsZoid Z-1000 Clip-On Tuner by Sabineor FOUR IntellisIntelli IMT500 Clip-on Chromatic Digital Tuner for Strings, I recommend that you consider the Zoid or Intelli."
1,5,"All that needs to be said is that  &#34; It's a Peterson &#34; Just the best Tuner's ever. I also use one on My Pedal Board, Wouldn't use anything else !!!!!!"
0,3,"Peterson makes some of the best and most accurate tuners and their high end strobe tuners are a must for the professional guitar repair shop allowing for accurate intonation and set ups. This tuner is accurate and I have even successfully set the intonation on a couple of my instruments using it (although it is not intended for this purpose). However I purchased it for the intention of taking it along to gigs in my guitar case. Unfortunately, due to the flimsy plastic construction I don't feel that it is up to the task and it would only be a matter of time before it gets broken if taken out of the house or on the road. Far better off purchasing a cheap Snark tuner that if lost or broken wouldn't be a big deal to replace and is accurate enough for most peoples use."
1,5,"USB Condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing Podcasts and for portability. The reason being is that they are condensers for one, and the other is that this mic has a built in interface. An interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and (Analogue to digital, and digital to analogue) AD/DA converters. Of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer; way, way better. So this MXL Studio 24 USB even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential. So instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one MXL Studio 24 USB all you need is a laptop with a USB input and you.There are limitations though with a USB mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments. (Although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your DAW.) Recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks.The really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money. So for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal, quick, easy, and affordable.One of the problems with using it in Pro Tools, or any DAW is that you can only use one interface at a time. Since the mic has a built in interface you can't use any other. Even in Garage Band for MAC, although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously. So in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a USB mic is not what you need. I have a couple of MXL condenser mics that I bought for my studio. I have the MXL V57M which was their early offering but is no longer made and I have found the MXL V250 to be comparable to that one. Some other MXL's like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end. When bottom fishing for a good/decent condenser mic some of the CAD offerings are also top sellers.When using the MXL 24 USB in Win 7 no driver download is necessary. If your mic comes without the included CD you can download the free MXL Studio Control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter. It also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold. There are also output adjustments as well.One other thing that is unique about USB mics working with your PC is that they are dependent of course on your PC. So I had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when I couldn't get the output from my PC or into the free Reaper DAW recording software (free 60 day trial) also downloadable from MXL. So I finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in Windows 7 accessible via Control panel, and then ""Sound"" and then type ""Troubleshooter"" into the search box in the upper right corner. The answer was that my mic input volume inside of Windows was down to zero. I moved the slider up and bang it worked.So for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into; it's a mini jack like you have on your computer. So with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod-casting, or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels. This mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic."
1,4,"This MXL Studio 24 USB Microphone is a decent choice for those needing a portable or a good quality studio microphone. We professionally produce instructional videos, both at our shop and at customer locations, and often need to voice over footage. This mic will replace theBlue Microphones Snowball USB Microphone (Textured White)we use in studio and also theMXL Mics MXL-STUDIO 1 USB Condenser Microphone, Cardioidwe had previously used for off-site recording.Pros -* Good Voice Quality; cleanly captures spoken voices* Good Physical Quality; this is beefy mic that feels very well made* Looks Professional; while not important to the functionality, it makes a good impression on our customers* Long USB Cord; allows for placement away from PC* Headphone Jack; ""real time monitor"", handy to listen to live recording and playback* Travels Well; includes a protective travel case that fits all of componentsCons -* No Pop-Filter Included; normally I wouldn't mention this but the instructions include a warning the condenser mics are susceptible to water damage (like from breath moisture) and a pop-filter is ""essential"". We boughtNady MPF-6 6-Inch Clamp On Microphone Pop Filter* Left Channel; only brings in audio on the left channel, had to compensate in my editing softwareMisc -* Since we do not do music recording of any type, I can't comment on the mic's performance in that area* Software; Studio Control GUI (downloadable) can be launched to control some of the finer functions of the microphone, but the interface is not intuitive and my editing software (Sony Vegas Pro) gives me better control for what we doThe MXL Studio 24 mic more than meets our needs (which may be different from yours).Recommended!CFH"
1,4,"I love my MXL 2010 microphone for its versatility, warmth in capturing the voice, and build quality. Most reviews I've read of MXL microphones have always emphasized it's clear and warm qualities it brings in our voices and instruments. The MXL Studio 24 aims at the consumer whom seeks a high quality condenser microphone without the usb interface. It keeps recording equipment minimal, literally connecting just through the usb cable. In short, the MXL Studio 24 has an excellent build (stand & microphone), easy to use software, and clear recording capabilities.Features:1) 22mm Condenser Capsule (not very big, but will suit most people)2) Cardioid pattern (I recommend also looking at microphones with figure 8 and omnidirectional patterns if those suit your needs better)3) Zero Latency monitoring (a bonus feature that not all condenser microphones have)4) Frequency response 20 Hz - 20 kHz (My MXL 2010 has a 30Hz - 20kHz. The 30hz merely means it can capture even more lowest lows)5) Output 1/8"" headphone jack, USB audio6) High pass filter 120Hz, 235Hz, 465Hz (software controlled)7) Lightweight 340gThoughts- Very impressive build. It's built like a rock & has a very fine finish. The grill and the frame around the grill are solid. I was surprised at how heavy the base was. It has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place. It's not some cheap plastic.- The recording capability is parallel to my experience with myMXL 2010 Multi-pattern Studio Mic. The clarity and power isn't nearly as good as the MXL 2010, but is certainly close. Using an USB interface, a condenser microphone gets more power and you are able to tweak the settings a bit more. With USB, it's a bit more set for you, but that may suit some people perfectly. If you want minimal tweaks out of the box with some occasional tweaks later with the software, this is a solid option.- Easy to use. Plug it in via USB and you literally on your way. The software installation is optional. The microphone works without it. Windows 7 64 bit detected this microphone with no hiccups.SummaryThe MXL Studio 24 USB microphone is aimed at users whom seek higher quality recording with an excellent build. There are certainly cheaper USB condenser microphones, but not many compare to the build and durability of MXL products like this one. To me, the fairly luxurious price of the MXL 24 is justified with it's excellent build, clear recording, and the ease of use. If you're not too sure about getting this USB condenser microphone or any USB microphone for that matter, I recommend getting a condenser microphone (non-USB) and plugging that in via USB interface. If you need any guidance at all with that process, I'm more than willing to help out. Cheers"
1,4,"I occasionally give radio interviews and participate in telephone conference calls. I'm also toying with the idea of eventually doing a podcast and/or recording audiobooks. When I first opened this package I was struck how sturdy and professional-looking this microphone was. Even the case impressed me. The travel case is elegant and beautifully designed all by itself.The microphone was easy to put together and place on its stand. One thing I didn't like was having Reaper pushed on me. I've successfully used Audacity for years, and, even more important, it's a free program that does everything I ask of it. I installed Reaper and immediately disliked its interface. It also repeatedly yelled at me about how if I used it past 60 days it was going to make me pay for it. I didn't like its tone, so I uninstalled it. MXL really should reconsider its association with Reaper.I tested the Microphone on a phone call using Google Voice. Everyone I spoke with said the voice quality was superior to the cheaper mike I've been using. I also tested it with Audacity in recording my voice. Again, I was very happy with the results.The packaging materials said that I should have received a CD in the package. I looked everywhere but couldn't find it; apparently I need it for something called a custom Grahic User Interface (GUI). I emailed technical support ... and I'm still waiting to hear back. Not cool.So Reaper and customer service are definite negatives, but the equipment itself is outstanding."
0,3,"This microphone only records in mono, and if you're unsure of what that means, it doesn't capture sound to it's full potential, and doesn't create a left/right feeling. All recordings sound like it is coming from just one direction, and though this is useful for some things such as podcasts, I wouldn't recommend it to a musician looking for great voice quality. It looks nice, and it would b e great for a Skype call, but it really wasn't what I was expecting when i opened the box up and tested it out. If you're looking for a mono microphone, this is however a very good mono microphone."
0,3,"This is an intriguing idea for a microphone: a nice condenser with built-in monitoring.  A possible simple solution for the musician who really wants to keep a rig minimal.  It seemed to me that I should test it both as a microphone and as a USB IO device.  The very first appearance is impressive.  There's a nicely-compartmentalized carrying case.  Inside, there's a milled aluminum desk stand, a cable, a short manual and the microphone.  No shock mount. The mic looks good, but has almost no mass.  While this may not mean much, I own and have used lots of mics--none of them this lacking in heft.I set up a shootout in my studio. I have an acoustically-treated room with calibrated studio monitors, so I think I can do a fair test.  I kept it simple, using a steel string guitar played in several styles.  For a comparison mic, I used an AKG Perception 420.  This is a multipattern mic that's only a little more expensive; a cardiod-only version is exactly the same price as this MXL.  I used only the cardiod pattern, so I think it's a fair comparison on the basis of price.  To get to the point, the AKG beat the MXL in every way.  It was quieter, with a much better midrange.  A glance at the specs (online at MXL) shows a significant boost in higher frequencies, leading to about a 3dB rise at 8K or so.  The polar pattern is shown only in broadband (not at multiple frequencies) and it shows a dip at the 45-degree position.  These were things I could easily hear.So purely as a microphone, the MXL doesn't match up to other mics in its price range.  But that's not a complete comparison.  The MXL has a little headphone jack on the side so that the performer can listen with zero latency.  That's a plus that comes with a couple of big minuses.  The mic is vulnerable to cable scrapes and vibrations coming down the headphone cable--better make sure you hold still when you use it.  There's also a volume knob that appears to affect both listening and recording level.  This means that it's easy to inadvertently skew recording levels when you're mounting the mic or tweaking your listening level.There's also an optional software control panel (Mac and Windows) that goes with the mic.  It provides a noise gate and compressor as long as some basic controls for recording and monitoring.  I'm unlikely ever to use this dynamics processing; once done, it can't be undone.  I'd apply those after the fact when I've got plenty of time to dial them in.  This leaves the level controls--a place where MXL could have been more careful.  There's a microphone gain which works in conjunction with the thumbwheel on the mic itself.  It takes some doing to figure out which does what.  There's a highpass filter--tremendously useful when rumble is a problem.  But we don't know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain.  I hope it's analog, but there's nothing about it in the documentation.  Then there's the biggest problem.  There's a playback level control which allows your mix to play back through the mic's headphone jack.  But this also means that--depending on your DAW--it's easy to set up a feedback path.  You won't like that.The biggest question in my mind is ""just who is this microphone for""?  A traditional mic can be connected to any preamp and used at any sample rate.  I have mics (both expensive and inexpensive) that I've had for years and years.  Only the preamp/interface changes.  This MXL is USB-only, 44/48 only.  You can't easily set up multiples of USB mics without clocking issues.  Most USB/FIrewire mic preamps have a zero-latency monitoring mode, so the mic doesn't really offer anything you can't get elsewhere.  In the end, I don't really think this is a good choice for any but the most casual of musicians.  To me, that milled aluminum desk mount holds the answer.  If you're a podcaster or a serious Skyper, then this mic deserves consideration.  It's a decent mic for spoken voice--the HF boost is helpful in bringing out articulation--and the single USB connection keeps your desk uncluttered.  Of course, there are plenty of other choices for that application.  But I think that's the best light to shine on this one."
1,5,"Too much noise with one spot. This was way better.Lot of feature.Outlets 1&#8211;3 can all be used to power either 9V or 12V pedals. For each outlet, just use the VOLTAGE SELECTOR switches to choose the voltage you need, plug in your pedal and go!Outlet 4 works the same way and gives you a similar choice &#8211; except that it&#8217;s between 9V and 18V.Outlets 5 and 6 may only be used one at a time. If you use them both at the same time, you might get some noise. Like outlets 1&#8211;3, outlet 5 gives you a choice between 9V and 12V. Outlet 6 is a 12V AC outlet for pedals that require AC power.6 isolated outputs delivering 300mA each (centre pin is negative) AC output at connector 6. Will power all pedals.Most of my pedals are 20 to 30 mA. So potentially I could have 40 plus pedals in a chain. AwesomeAll the cables you needLike all T-Rex Fuel Tank power supplies, your new Chameleon comes with a full set of cables to help you keep your board clutter-free. Once you&#8217;ve selected your voltage options, just plug in and play!Excellent!Don't even think about it.Just get it.Highly recommend it"
1,5,"Its a very nice way to ensure all your pedals are powered properly. And ive noticed it helps cut down on excessive noise generated by pedals with when cheaper power sources are in use. I wish the power cable for the supply was longer but its nothing an extension cable cant fix. Weird thing was that the switches for voltage options were installed upside down. I lt didnt bother me really but if you get the same situation and you cant stand it, im sure you coukd just open it up and flip the little switch box around."
1,5,"I picked up an old Boss ME-6B that required the Boss BRA-120 power supply. That thing outputs 12vAC. It also has a different size connector. Being that those wallwart power supplies go for around  thirty dollars, I wasn't interested. So instead I spent ninety more dollars on this fuel tank and got a DC Power Plug 5.5x2.1mm to 6.3X3.0mm female adapter. Using  the 12vAC output on my Fuel Tank Chameleon works great. Awesome overkill solution. It also powers everything else and looks fine doing it."
1,5,"This power supply is unbelieveble versatile... when i first saw this i believed it was only for 6 pedals but it turns out it can power up A LOT pedals better than any power supply out there.... this power up my 12 pedals i got in my pedal board and i can even power more... im buying 3 more and it will work, only with this!! Thats why i say this is the best on the world!"
1,5,I was using a Joyo Power supply and when I bought my Fuzz I ran out of plugs so I bought this. It does the job. I plan on getting a couple of the Juniors next since I only have 1 18V pedal and the rest are 9's
1,4,its a must have for guitarist with multi effects.  it comes with a range of wires but I did not like that you camt use the last two ports together (the ac ports).  other than that it good
1,5,"With this power supply you can offer to your pedals 9Vdc, 12Vdc, 18Vd or 12Vac. I'm using 8 pedals conected to this power supply, and I don't have any kind of noise or hum."
1,5,"I love this guitar!! It has a terrific sound and it's GORGEOUS!  The gig bag, although not padded, works very well and is well made.  The pockets are very handy.  All in all...one of the best purchases I've made for the money.  VERY HAPPY!!"
1,5,I believe I've rated this instrument before.  I really like that it plays easily and has a good sound to it.  I also like the fact that it doesn't require a 9 Volt Battery whereas others I played did.  I would buy from this company again and probally will in the future.  Thank You.
1,5,"This is an amazing guitar. I couldn't put it down, I have experience playing really, really expensive guitars. My $500 ""beater"" acoustic I was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all, I couldn't imagine what I would b getting for $90. By was I wrong. It's my best acoustic currently! This thing sounds like, sustains, and holds its' own tune like a similar $2000.00+ Martin model and that's ZERO exaggeration! Get it and see, you will be blown away. I bought a second one. I just wish I had found this guitar sooner."
1,4,"This is a good beginner or intermediate guitar but if you play for profit get something better. Cheap case but does at least fit the guitar. I like it but I'm just playing for entertainment and at church some times. Electronics are just volume, and tone but it rocks my little battery powered Honeytone amp. Nice finish, nice guitar.. For the money ; )"
1,5,"Right out of the box, playable!  I did a tune up of the strings and they are holding pitch well after a couple of hours of playtime.  The electronics are just fine on the guitar I got.  I did have to adjust the string action down a bit, but hey, that goes with the territory.  There were some minor flaws in the finish, but for the money spent, this is a real workhorse and plays great!"
1,4,"It is a nice strap.  It takes care of business just fine.  I wish I could have found a more colorful style, but all I could find on line was black.  But it's a very good strap."
1,5,"This strap is comfortable, has plenty of room to expand it to fit, and is just wide enough to continue to be comfy around you.  Perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele, and even the extra thin travel ukes.  I really like it!"
1,5,I have had trouble finding uke sized straps and have often had to use the larger guitar straps. This fits just right and looks just right.  It's well made and not too expensive.  I just wish I had found them before buying all those guitar straps.
1,5,"I ordered this strap to use with both my concert & tenor ukes.  It just works.I already owned a ukulele leash-type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke's sound hole or tie it off to the head. The problem, of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body (sometimes disastrously).  With a strap like this one, you can completely let go of your uke & it stays perfectly in place. Chord changes & strumming become easier when you don't have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck.This is a nice size strap, not to wide not to narrow.  The length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke (and uke player) sizes. It does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke. The other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way. In my case I installed two buttons - more convenient and the strap doesn't interfere with my chord-hand. Here are the buttons I used:Strap ButtonsIf the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant, put your fears aside. It can be done quickly & easily and the end result is well worth it. Here's an entertaining how-to video that will walk you through it: (...)"
1,4,but I keep thinking it is going to interfere with tuning at the nutwill be trying to get more use in.
1,4,A well-designed strap that looks and works really nice. I'd say it's a little expensive. They should cut the price down by at least 1/3 and it would be a 5 star rating.
1,5,"I looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one.  I hesitated a bit because I couldn't find anywhere that they specified the width, but it was a good price, so I took a chance.  It's about one and a half inches wide, by the way.  I'm very happy with it and I like that it has the flexibility to attach one end to either the headstock or a button.  I can't think of any negatives, it's a nice, functional, non-flashy strap that does it's job well, and it's wide enough that it doesn't feel like it's digging into my shoulder."
1,5,for the price and effect itself u can not get a better deal.use it for my acoustic guitar  pedal board though. it just does the job and im more than satisfied.it works awesome with electric guitar too. just get it!
1,4,"Was a little hesitant to get a stomp pedal, especially a delay, for this price. But I figured, how can you go wrong...if it's not good, at least you're not out a lot of money. I've been thoroughly impressed with this pedal. Much more sturdy than it appears in photos. I actually like that the input and output jacks are at the front of it. Works great so far and don't regret purchasing...worth every dime...where else can you get a great-functioning delay pedal for this price?"
1,5,"this is very inexpensive and works great for my home-wanna be purposes.  it is not superloaded with heavy delay, etc. but it definitely gives you the effect.  it links well with other pedals.  the Battery wears out pretty quick and it does not come with a 9 v plug in.  therefore, I would recommend spending a couple of bucks and get a standard 9V plug in on Amazon or at a local electronics store and not worry about the batteries always going dead.I like it enough that I will probably get a few more of this company's petals as the effect is good and the price is right.for my limited purposes, this works great.  if you are a pro gigging or on the road, you probably want to get a more versitile, heavy duty and expensive delay petal."
1,4,"This delay is really nice, especially for the price.  I am a fan of the FAB line of effects and have several of them.  My favorite is this delay and the Echo.  They have been very durable and I am confident that the plastic body of the pedals will remain durable.  My only complaint is the markings on the level knobs.  They have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see.  This could have been more thoughtfully desingned with a thick bright white line that would contrast against the knob surface.  This can be done yourself with a paint marker or whiteout brush, but it should have been considered ahead of time."
0,2,Bought this for a friend. Cheap plastic enclosure. Affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay. He tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay. Stay away from this one and get a better used pedal.
1,5,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-8 600Ms Delay effects pedal works great and gives me as much delay as I need .  There's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the delay you want with no effort at all..  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
1,5,Like most of the other Danelectro pedals this one has a great sound and in this case a fairly inexpensive price though it is higher than most of their other pedals.  Once again though get the AC-DC adapter for it as it'll put you in the poor house supplying 9v's to it...it eats them like candy
1,4,"The delay pedal was inexpensive and it works.  I dont find a lot of variance in the adjustments, but it does the job it was made for.  The case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged."
1,5,"I love these cheap little pedals.I don't know if these would make a long tour with rough use - but they will be good for small club use with a careful handler.Great for around the house and rehearsal.A little noisy - but what do you expect at this price, right?So far very reliable after a few months of use. I will take this out on a little club tour and post back with problems and reliability concerns and if there are any preventative measures to address beforehand.Otherwise - great product. They look cool also - like something out of the 60's Star Trek or something.*************************************09/27/2013I still use this pedal on my main pedal board - it just sounds so good!Sound guy asked me about it the other night - and when I showed it to him he didn't believe me.$10 for some of the best analog delay sounds out there - who needs boutique pedals?"
1,5,"I have two delay pedals, both inexpensive (this one and a Behringer) and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap Behringer, the Danelectro sounds more natural.  The Behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal, which is perfectly ok for some applications.  The Danelectro has a warmer, almost analog feel.  It sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos.  The case is plastic but unless you eat 3 times your weight at the Golden Corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet, you're not going to break it.  The only thing I don't like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it.  I suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the ""retro"" look of this pedal.  Ok, fine.  I've heard pedals costing twice as much that don't sound as nice as this one.  As one reviewer once wrote, there are guitarists who would rather catch AIDS than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board; I, however, think some of these cheap pedals function quite well, and in some cases, just as well as their more expensive counterparts.  If you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your Holy Grail, OCD, and other ""boutique"" pedals, I promise the other ones won't catch AIDS from this.  In fact, the whole ensemble will benefit."
1,4,"I've owned two of these pedals and they both  had the same quirk. The delay is amazing, the repeats trail and decay beautifully,The controls give you a wide range of tones...But, They've both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me!  One constant high pitched screeching tone!My signal chain was low gain, And its done it when it was the only pedal In the chain, so It's not  another pedals Influence... I love the sound, but, I won't use it live in case of feedback...That being said its still a very good pedal."
1,5,I replaced the older strings in my acoustic guitar.  While these strings are a bit harder to play (they are not forgiving on the fingertips of people just learning how to play) they do sound great. A lot better than the stock strings that came with the guitar.
0,3,"Whenever I played with traditional strings, my fingertips would turn green. This was because bare metal would react with the salt and sweat from my fingers and oxidize (similar to the Statue of Liberty). This corrosion causes the strings to become duller and worn out. The defining feature of this product is the coating which is meant to prevent moisture from causing this reaction. Therefore, your strings last much longer. Traditionally, the coating has reduced the sound quality of guitar strings. However, this product is wonderful! For the first 3 days the strings sound strange. But after they stretch out a little, they sound perfectly fine. My fingers have stopped turning green; proof that the product works! I have yet to buy another set of strings.2 months later:These strings have been great, but I do have to admit they do not last 3 to 5 times as long as advertised. They last about twice as long."
1,5,"These are outstanding strings that sound great; just a littler softer (to my ears) than the standard Martin strings. They last longer and are worth the difference in price over regular, non-coated strings."
1,4,"These do really well. I only wish I'd ordered the light's. I usually buy the Elizir, but I thought I'd give these a try. I'm sorry Martin, but I like the Elixer's the best. Just my opinion."
1,5,If you can't afford the best guitar on the market -then buy the best strings. I would highly recommend for any acoustic guitar.
1,5,People tell you you need to buy a 1000 dollar tube amp to sound good..shuuut up..mic this through a PA and you;re set never need another amp againUse amp modeling software that fender includes and you have a vast array of tones..for 100 bucks..Spend money on a top end guitar if you get this amp its all you need
1,5,"I haven't picked up a guitar in 15 years, but this was a LONG Winter and I needed something to occupy my time.I broke out my Strat and discovered that the amp was dead - mice had eaten the wiring.Crap.So - Online to see what defined ""State of the Art"".  This is It.If you need a basic practice amp that, with a decent laptop and internet connection, can help you produce ANY sound with a few simple instructions THIS IS IT.No Foot pedals or expensive add-ons [until you really have to have them]... Just pure creative sound that won't break the bank.Buy This Amp !"
1,5,"The last amplifier I purchased was a Fender Twin valve some years ago. It is difficult to use in a small apartment - too loud!! So, after giving up trying to use this with the volume at '1', I searched for a smaller thing. This amp looked suspiciously cheap and, although the reviews were great, still was concerned whether it would be good enough. It arrived and I got into realizing it went on the web for downloading presets and all kinds of features, including recording. This was really a mind blowing thing. The built in sounds and effects are better than many of my effect pedals, and I no longer use my Zoom. Setting it emulate a twin reverb, with the effects used lightly, I am amazed at both the quality of this 'practise amp' and recommend this to anybody who wants a huge bang for their buck!!!"
1,5,"This amp is a ton of fun. The presets sound great by themselves, but you can also spend hours tweaking the sounds with the Fender Fuse software. It is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike."
1,5,"I LOVE THIS AMP. Here are the reasons: Solidly made, everything is high quality.  Best of all it comes with Fender Fuse software whereby you can hook it up to your PC using the USB cable (included) and &#34;control&#34; all of the amps features over and above the actual settings on the amp(without even touching the knobs) INCLUDING special effects like various stomp box add-ins, effects like reverb, distortion, phaser, factory presets on the dials etc and you can even select different amps on the PC screen visually. You can also go online through the app and download presets other people have created. If you want to play a Pink Floyd song you can download a David Gilmour preset and there you go. You got your Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall preset ready to go.  This is so cool and 20 watts beats 10 and works for me.  I can record directly from the amp into my PC Mixpad software program."
1,5,"I got mine in a trade for practically nothing. I figured I could sell it and make a few bucks, saw the Mustang amp around but never gave it any credibility, looked like a toy to me. Anyway I decided to plug it in and was shocked at the full sound of the little 8 inch speaker. I researched and found there is a program called Fuse that can interface with the amp. I downloaded and linked to the amp, there I saw you can make a lot of changes that can't be done with just the knobs. I saw it had a Deluxe Reverb setting. I have the Deluxe Reverb Reissue so dialed in the same settings with the fuse software. To my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my Deluxe! Fender really got close with the modeling. I went ahead and programmed a few more patches and set up a footswitch to change between 2 settings. I liked it so much I went out and bought the Mustang II. I almost like the Mustang I better but the II does have enough power to gig with if you aren't a loud band. I will leave my Deluxe Reverb at home for my next small gig and use the Mustang, maybe even the little one and mic it up.."
1,5,"I ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly.  It arrived in a large box and within in the Fender Amp box.  I guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection.  Sadly, when I tried to use them amp, it didn't work!  I checked the wall plug, cord, flicked several switches and knobs but still didn't work.  Needless to say, I sent the amp back to Amazon which was quick and painless.  I wanted an exchange.  I expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me.  But I was shocked to find out that as soon as the return UPS label was recorded at the UPS store, they shipped out another amp.  And it arrived in 4 days since I returned the first one!  WOW!!! That's customer service.The amp is great.  Small footprint, sounds great for what I want it for which is bedroom/basement practice amp.  Does it's job very nicely.  I explored the FUSE software and the potential is almost endless.  Honestly, I don't think I will every fully utilize the full capability of the FUSE software.  I just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there.  I may use someone else's uploaded presets and play with the various options later on.  In summary, 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service."
1,5,"This is really a great amp for the price.  If you're new to electric guitar, and you want an amp to get started, buy this one.  It has incredible versatility, and you can get started with trying out a huge range of different sounds without having to invest in a variety of effects and different amps.I got much more than I expected for the price of this amp.  I really like the Bassman and Twin Reverb settings.I won't claim that you can buy this amp and never have need for something bigger, better, vintage tube, etc., but this will more than meet your needs to use at home.  Buy the 20W version, which is plenty loud for home.  Later - when you have the skills to justify it, start buying some tube equipment.  This amp will help you figure out what tones you like for the music you want to play.I considered various new/used amps in the same price range, and I'm extremely happy I picked this one.  If you came by my house with some other brand new amp that cost twice as much as this and wanted to trade me, I'd tell you to go away.  But if you stop by with a nice Twin Reverb, I'd give up my Mustang ... but then I'd go buy another one."
1,5,"Bought this amp probably about two years ago. The amp has 3 levels of 8 presets each, for a total of 24 unique presets, ranging form heavy metal distortion sounds and reverberating clean tones. (The '65 Twin Reverb on the Orange Level is by far my favorite.) The amp includes gain, a volume and separate master volume knob in addition to bass and treble knobs. I feel like it is a bargain at any price. A great amp for practice and beginners."
1,5,Takes you hours to play around with all the sounds. Built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage. Nice and loud in a small package.
1,5,"I love small amps and have played many of them over the last 25 years. I still own a few, my favorite being the first Super Champ from the early '80s; Rivera nailed that one. I naturally prefer tubes for that true tone, but tried one of these out last year at a pal's place and was sold within two minutes. I bought one six months ago and after playing it almost daily since then I can say without doubt that this is the most versatile solid state practice amp I've ever used.For the money it's a crazy deal. I have never once used the included online stuff or the Ableton software, so those add even more value to this package, no doubt. All I wanted was a warm up amp with real tone, and this is that and plenty more. My all-time favorite tone is the clean glassy Fender late-'50s/early '60s sound, typified by the Bassmans and Twins and Deluxes of the pre-CBS era. That tone needs tubes to really sing, but to my amazement the amp modeling of this Mustang comes amazingly close to that sound without tubes. You'll always miss that tube sag but the crispness and snap is all there, especially on the Bassman settings. My Strats sound so damn good through this on clean settings, and my PRS absolutely smokes with real lease-breaking volume on Super-Sonic (dial the gain way back for a nice low-throttle roar).Having gain, volume and master lets you dial in a TON of tones with each amp model, and the two separate effects knobs let you add chorus/tremolo etc plus various reverbs/delays etc, though I find myself keeping everything totally clean as time goes by; if I can't get the tone I want with my fingers then I need to learn how to is my motto. And this amp is so accurate that I can.Above all, this Mustang is MUSICAL. For a small amp that's a real feat, but for 100 clams it's a near miracle. Add a built in tuner (the most useful ""extra"" ANY amp can have), good effects, great amp models, the software and more online amp models (which I'll get around to one day but so far I get all the tone I need from the amp as it is), plus 20 watts for lots of headroom, and this is a straight up steal for a bill.The only thing missing is serious bass at volume, but this is an 8 after all, not a 10, so you'll always miss some of the real bottom. But what's there is solid and tight and only craps out at top volume; only with a rock drummer will you need more roar than this provides. You could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy.All told, the Mustang I is easily not only the best value practice amp of them all out there now (Crate and Line 6 etc don't come close), but paired with a mini-Strat this would be the absolutely PERFECT beginner's set up for a kid looking to play anything from the Beatles to Metallica and everything in between.Can't recommend this highly enough to anyone who thinks real tone can't come in a small solid state amp. It can, it does, and it's cheaper than I can still believe.Fender truly went to 11 on this one.Leo would be proud!"
1,4,"The Mustang 1 was a great buy for another great Fender product.  It has more bells and whistles than I can mention but it's sophistication is lost on me.  I was looking for a clean crisp sound with little or no distortion and with the Mustang it seemed that's all I was getting.  Great little amp, just not for me."
1,5,"I bough this amp for my 9 year old son who is learning guitar for his Christmas present.  I thought that since I love Fender guitars and since he has a mini Squier we'd like to get something in the Fender Family.  I seriously expected a cheap imitation of a Line 6 Spider with a Fender logo slapped on it.  I should have had more faith in Fender.I am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp.  The AMP models are far more real and interesting sounding than any modeling tool I have ever used.  The amps don't sound digital or processed, they actually sound overdriven when you crank the gain.  You would swear that there are tubes in this thing when you listen to it.  I can't get over the Bassman, the twin Reverb and the Deluxe.  They sound so full and strong.My biggest compliment of the Mustang is that it is the ONLY modeling amp that has great sounding Vintage tones.  Line 6 has tons of metal stuff, and a lot of weird niche tones.  Vox has never really made great modeling stuff.  Digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible.If you play Blues, Rock, Classic Rock, Country, Funk etc... This amp is for you.  There is just enough metal or heavy sounds to have a few choices for Modern Metal, but Metalheads might be better off with the Line 6 stuff.The other great thing about this amp is how easy it is to tweak the tones using the amp controls.  By looking at the controls, you know right where you are and what you have to do to edit your sound.  You don't need to dive 5 levels deep into an LCD screen in order to make great sounding tweaks.But if you like to go deep, you'll love the Fender Fuse software.  It is easy to use and there are countless user submitted tones to help shape your sound.The fact that Fender not only included FUSE with this amp, but also the Ableton recording software that is also pretty user friendly and fully usable without having to pay to upgrade anything, is just frosting on the cake.I am a father of 4 who normally has to practice at night and being able to have an amp that can get quiet but still sound amazing, with the added features of a headphone jack and an AUX in, I can play whenever I want.  I am actually selling my nice Tube amp and using the Mustang as my only amp for now, and I feel like I am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at all.The value of this amp is amazing.  People will shell out 2-3x as much for a Line 6 modeler, but the vintage tones will not sound anywhere close to as good as the Fender tones."
1,5,"This amp is awesome! Its great JUST like it's advertised. I play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the Fender Fuse software. Fender Fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed & advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire. The amp itself has 24 presets (as advertised) & are shown in 3 different colors (Red, Green, & Orange)  and you can totally customize the presets. So if you want 24 different distortions go for it! Another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials & learn how to use it & record some music but you can't save them (bummer i know) BUT! it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings. One last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal (about $20)the Fender mustang 1&2 can only USE the 1 button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses 2 buttons or up can only be use by Fender Mustangs 3 & up REMEMBER THIS!"
1,5,"I have been playing for over three decades, and it has been a while since I have owned an electric guitar.  I bought this amp along with a Epi Les Paul 100.  All I can say is wow!  This is a great combination.This amp has almost an unlimited number of tones and effects.  Well built and looks even better in person than the picture.  Plenty of power as well.  Better than anything including the stage quality amps like Marshals from back in the day.  A great practice amp, but good enough you could use it for a small gig.  Going to pick up the optional foot switch.If you buy you won't be disappointed."
1,5,"I've just received my Mustang I and have spent an hour playing with it and the Fuse software.  This thing is outrageous for a practice amp and I've never heard anything like it in its price class and size!  With a good instrument mic and a decent monitoring system, I think you could probably gig with this thing.  One feature in the Fuse software that no one seems to mention is the ability to add an overdrive or compressor module ""post gain"" (after the preamp). This is an incredibly useful tool for controlling the overdrive characteristics of the amp models.  In effect, Fender has given this amp the ability to emulate power section saturation as the overdrive module sounds very different and much mellower post gain than pre gain (before the preamp like a normal stomp box).I don't know of any other dedicated modelers that do this except maybe the Axe-FX - and that costs about 20 times more.  Power section saturation is highly desirable and is the reason why we're seeing a lot of very low power tube amps like the Fender Champion 600 and Bugera V5 these days. Their problem is that they're pretty much useless for clean sounds at louder volumes - they don't have enough power for that so they're really only good for overdriven sounds.  Not so the Mustang I.  I think Fender has hit the perfect combination of flexibility and and simplicity in one package.  This thing sounds way bigger than it looks and way better than its price would suggest. It has the classic Fender sound and feel of many different Fender amps without the weight, cost and tube replacement needs.  What's not to like?"
1,5,"For $99 you get the best good sized, heavy duty, high quality amp with tons of SOUND!-Construction: Solid, good material and parts, Fender used the good stuff.-Sound: Nice clear & LOUD sound especially for an 8"" speaker and 20W amp. You can definitely jam with a drummer no problem, or just shred it wearing headphones.-Effects: There are 9 ""amp models"" (i.e. ""57 deluxe"", ""metal 2000"", etc...) and with these 9 amp sounds to choose from, you can apply 24 effects on top of any of the 9 amp models.The effects include chorus, deep chorus, flange, tremelo, vibration, phaser, step filter, delay (150ms, 300ms, 700ms), Reverb, large hall, small room, echo filter, octaver, etc...)So what are the presets? Each of the 9 amp models has been pre-programmed with three different presets (meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds).When you select a preset, like the first metal 2000 for example, the minute you touch the ""gain"" knob, the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set. Same with treble, bass, volume, and all other effects. The moment you touch any dials or effects knobs, you have custom control to tweak each preset, just temporarily, or save it if you wish.It's so great, because often I feel I would have made a present slightly more this or that, simply grab the gain or change the treble, or move from delay to reverb and make it your own! Very easy.-Ease of use: Plug in your guitar, spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects. Plug in ipod or computer with 3.5mm male cable. It's that easy!-PC Software: I've heard their is trouble installing, mine said ""error"" and did not install on Windows 7. I know there are ways to fix this, and I will do so when I have some time. Comes with a USB cable (mini for the amp, regular plug for the computer). Works for mac or PC, get more presets, use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer. Play on guitar rig and amplitude. Awesome.-Size: Perfect. Big enough to give it a serious look, and a quality feel. Small enough to fit easily under a table, next to your desk, etc. Looks like 18""x18"" to me. The front metal-looking grill is mesh, but quality and looks great.-Tuner: Super simple. Doesn't tell you which note is in tune, just tells you left, right, or green in center for ""in tune"".All in all when compared to the Line 6 Spider, and many other fender amps, this one has the quality sound, the dozens of different effect combinations, input for a footswitch, aux for ipod, and USB for computer. It has it all. I jam through headphones for hours each day since I bought it. The reverb and gain distortion are so clean, and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone. My guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender amp.Don't sleep on this, it's $99 for a loud quality amp with $1,000s worth of effects peddles built in.And did I mention, EASILY CUSTOMIZABLE so easy I could teach a 5 year old. Select a preset, change the dials you want to change, make changes permanent only by hitting ""save"" otherwise presets stay the way the factory made them.LOVE THIS AMP, and I've shopped EVERY comparable model. This is the one, hands down worth a minimum of $150.Louder than my friends 60W!:D ONE LOVE FENDER MUSTANG YOU ROCK!"
1,4,"Great little amp, but get a tube amp if you're serious about playing guitar. It will sound a lot better and it's not too much more expensive. Solid state just isn't the same.I'll also say that it's quite difficult to get a natural sound out of this amp without a lot of tweaking. Even then, you won't get a great clean tone. The Fender Champ X2 is a great alternative to the more expensive and desiralble vintage Fender Vibro Champ. Go with Quality and save yourself a future purchase (resale vale is great on the X2 as well)."
1,5,It's been a while since last we got together. The old amps we had were way too big. For me this one is just right.Fender Mustang I Electric Guitar Amplifier
1,5,"Well over the past 4 years I've been running through a bunch of these mini, micro, battery powered, small tubed, and solid state, model budget amplifiers.Lets see, done all the Blackheart small amps, the Vox mini-3 & AC4TV, Roland MICRO-CUBE, plus a few other small amps. I just sold my Fender Super Champ XD and wasn't going to get another amp because playing in my apartment with neighbors, I just cannot jam the way I'd like to...I really liked all the above named amps but they really didn't give me the options of cranking it without disturbing my neighbors. Loved the Fender Super Champ probably the best, but there wasn't a headphone jack. Same with the Blackhearts and the Vox AC4TV and the potential of these amps just couldn't be used by me. So I settled on the Vox Mini-3 (4watt), because it has a headphone jack, is also A/C or battery powered, among a lot of other great features and sounds.. but I did have to give up tube amp option...So as I said I sold my Super Champ like a week ago and as I was mailing it out using the Amazon online mailing appz when I saw a picture and price (in the browser) on this new Fender Mustang I and I figured... what the hell. Lets see what its got to offer for under $100. I mean everyone was giving it a 5-star rating, so whats a $100 bucks, even though I've never had a good sounding solid state amp.Well I must say this thing rocks! There are like 3 phases of model amps, most I didn't like at first but was able to fine tune most of em to sound pretty great. I mean its only a $100 amp so it cannot be compared to the real deals, but it does stand up pretty nice. Plus it has the headphone jack (and a couple other plugins and effects) and this thing will blow your ears out. Most amplifier headphone jacks.. tap out and never got loud enough for me, but this thing screams and blow-out your ears. I've had it now like 3 days and was thinking about sending it back, but for $100, there's nothing in the market that can compare or compete with its, SOUND, low pricing, and options... So I'm now glad that I sold my Fender Super Champ XD and bought this one and put the other $150 back in my pocket... ya!This is the best solid state amp I've ever owned and I still miss the tube option.. But I'm sure something better will appear next year and until, then... well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this Fender AMP!"
1,5,"This little amp is amazing.  It's loaded with a lot of samples of other great amps, AND you can plug it in to your laptop and record it directly and you can go online and download other samples directly to your amp.  I love it!  If you need a practice amp (and you can plug your headphones in to it so you can practice in private) then this is the amp you  should buy.  The price is right, and the size is right.  Enough said.  Buy it!"
1,5,"It looks nicer than pictured, seems solid and well-constructed, but most important of all it sounds fantastic! I've only had this amp now for roughly a day, but stayed up a good part of last night playing. I couldn't stop. This morning I opened the outside doors and cranked it all the way up to about half volume. (Scared the cat and made the dog wonder what the heck that new thing is making all the noise.) Beyond the halfway setting, it would've hurt my ears. Yes, it's that loud! Absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and small-event purposes. So far, I've only played through the amber pre-sets and only experimented some with the modulations knob. I like the bluesy, tube-effect modelings the most and don't know that I'll see much need to go looking to create a lot of custom settings. But it's nice to know this amp can deliver, either with or without the additional FUSE software, such an incredibly diverse array of sounds should the need ever arise. Thanks, Fender!"
1,5,"I got this on sale from GC for $80 shipped (plus $7 tax arrrgh). First and foremost this amp is AMAZING.  All the hype and positive reviews you read are all true.  My playing style varies from horrible attemps at sounding like a real player to half way decent renditions of actual songs (lol) and this amp does it all.  The tube amp models sound like real tubes and have a tone and sound that just can't be described, they have to be heard.  The modulations, and del/reverbs are well done also.  There are a few of the effects that sound a little vanilla or digital but those can be tweaked with the Fuse software (or taken out completely).  All the controls are pretty easy to understand and adjust, and it does not take a brilliant mind to figure out how to make the amp sound good (even with my substandard playing ability!  Both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp.  The tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use.  Headphones work well also.  About my only real complaints are so minor- no place to store the Power cord or USB cord (included!).  Printed documentation is pretty lame but the included DVD is more through.  The Fuse software has to be downloaded and as I have limited online speed this took over an hour.  The headphone jack is a 3.5mm and most good headphones are still using the 1/4"".  Not a big deal but the 3.5mm to 1/4"" adaptors are somewhat weak and can be very touchy.  The amp gives an audiable POP when powered down.  No corner protectors on this.  All in all if you are looking for a great small amp this will give you $1000's of dollars worth of effects and amp models all for under 100 clams!"
1,5,"Originally put-off by the low price, I went with the reviews.  Simply AWESOME!  This amp is packed with features.  Beginner/Intermediate level player would be very pleased!  The best part is, it's not at all complex to learn the features."
1,4,"Great little amp to mess around with. The various sound changes and the range of sound mimics is amazing. The software that came with it is a little limited for true professionals but has more than you need for home use. Don't be fooled by the small size, this baby pumps out the noise quite well. I'd rarely turn my master volume above level 4 (of 10) for home use and at small local taverns I'd set it at around level 8. For a regular venue I have an extra Marshall 500-watt speaker system.You will need time to read the manual and learn the settings making it fun to see what kind of effects you can get. No pedals needed with this thing. I only gave it 4-stars because I later bought the Mustang III which has a bunch more features for an extra $200 and a blow-out 100-watt speaker. (The Mustang IV is the same as the III but with 150-watts. Again, you can but an extra 100-watt speaker for $40, making the extra $200 for a Mustang IV a waste.) The Mustang II is the same as this one but with a 40-watt speaker and $100 more.If you need something to play with at home and want to try different effects and sounds this is a good one at a cheap price. If you want the extra 20-watts (of the Mustang II) just buy this one and an extra 20-watt speaker (around $30) and jury rig it. Otherwise I recommend plunking the extra $200 and get the Mustang III with a digital display readout and more effects."
1,5,When I bought this it wasn't the amp I wanted but because of budget and reviews I picked it.  I couldn't be happier.  This little amp really impressed me.  Add Fender Fuse software and its probably the best $99 I've spent in a while
1,5,"I got one of these here on Amazon as a replacement for my other small practice amp, an older Fender 25 watt blackface two-channel that didn't have integrated EFX (that one has been more or less permanantly allocated to my church).Great little amp. Only had it for a couple days, but the sounds you can evoke out of this thing are amazing. Clean tones are pristine. Distortion tones, a bit on the transistory side, but again, I haven't played with the setting enough (or even tried all the emulations). Controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on. It is a bit lacking in low-end, to be expected from a small 8"" speaker. But that is okay for practice and rehearsal. It is loud enough for rehearsal with a drummer (depending on the style of music). I did purchase the single button footswitch as well and it works great at switching between any TWO settings you define.Have not had a chance to mess with the included software, but intend to do that when I have time. I like the fact that I can tweak the amp to my EXACT preferences and it stays in memory; I only really have to do it once. Great feature.Only suggestions to Fender would be to add a recessed area in the back to stow the power cord (standard computer type) and optionally, the included USB cable.Overall, for the price, it is an incredible value. Great alternative to lugging my full rig (Marshall 2X12 cab, racked Rocktron Pirhanna, ADA 100 watt tube head, Alesis Midiverb IV and some other stuff). Get yours while you can at this price.UPDATE -- The Fender software that you can download and use with this amp is freaking amazing. I now have it more or less permanently attached to my computer via USB and am constantly tweaking and refining my tones. The Princeton amp emulation is SWEET. I am going to buy a second one, probably the larger Mustang III, cause I want the larger Celestion speaker. You know, pretty much every Fender product I have ever purchased has been first rate, and this amp is no exception. And I don't care if it is made in Mexico (my guitar is a differnt matter though...)"
1,5,im not a profesional player but i like to play once in a while just for fun and this sound great.
0,1,"My review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. When I first got it I liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first I thought it was great. Then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. Go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things. Fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and I don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body, unless I have a grand to pay for an older one, I'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. Also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people I've read the complaints I was trying not to realize, as I didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, BUT I DID!And I am so glad I did. I almost got a peavey vypyr, and I am glad I didn't. This amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which I read on fender's own forum/website, FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS, BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.I've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and I was like ""what music snobs"" and what have you. But I realized that I'm a music snob! I love the music I listen to more than anything, and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well. So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt, cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn't have that crackle sound, but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return, as after that, it would have been final.The decision I did make I think will be great for me, as I'd rather start with a good real tone, then get the effects I need. I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying ""throw away your pedals, you won't need them"" and ""I was going to get pedals, but don't need to now"", that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.I think if I played this at a GC I wouldn't of gotten it, and I just tried to make myself like it."
1,5,"As far as amps that model vintage tones.  This is the best.For my ear, Line 6, Vox, Crate, Digitech etc are nowhere near the Fender Mustang if you are comparing Vintage tones.I have played amps and effects from many companies, as well as many of the 'hybrid amps' that combine tube and digital tones, and if you are looking for the best recreation of Vintage Blues, Rock, Hard Rock, Country tones... the type of tones that you get from some of the famed Fender amps, the Mustang Series is as good as you are going to do.I originally bought the Mustang I for my 9 year old son to be his first practice amp and when we hooked it up for him, I could hardly let him play.The tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp.  It is easy and straight forward to see what you need to do to tweak your sound just by turning knobs.  When you add the Fender FUSE to the mix and start to download new tones from the web and tweak it with dozens of stomp boxes and effects that are free to play with and try and keep on your amp this is an amazing value. (not to even mention the Ableton recording software that comes for free with the amp.)The reason I love this amp is because of the faithful recreation of the great Fender amps like the Bassman, Deluxe Reverb, and Twin Reverb.  I have never heard a digital sound replicate tube amps even close to this well.I have heard several people say that they would never buy this amp because it is not a tube amp or because they are not computer savvy.For the Tube amp snobs...Nothing is going to match the sound of a really great Fender Tube amp.  But if you want to recreate great fender amps at low volumes the Mustang will be a great practice amp for you. OR... if you want to bring an amp to practice that weighs a fraction of what your Fender Tube amps weighs, the mustang is a great choice.  I am selling my only tube amp now that I have the Mustang II because I don't gig and really need an amp that I can practice with at night while the kids are in bed.For the Non-Computer folk...There is plenty to keep you occupied on this amp without ever plugging it into a computer.  And if you want to give it a try, it couldn't be easier to download new sounds and tweak your favorite tones.For the Metalheads...This amp probably is not for you.  Go try and buy a higher gain Line 6 or the Vox ADT series of hybrid amps to get some really heavy tones.  There are some decent metal tones to download on the FUSE, but the real strength of this amp is Vintage tones.Let me make it clear!  I played my son's Squier Mini guitar through this amp and it sounds really amazing.  I have a Fender Strat, Squier Tele and a Les Paul and they all sound amazing in this amp.This is the first piece of guitar equipment that has given me absolutely NO buyers remorse.  Unbeatable value.  A great toy.  A perfect practice tool.  You can't beat it."
1,5,"Well, just got it, plugged in and here are some initial impressions.1. Pretty much what I expected - much more ""relaxed"" at higher volumes than the M1.2. Definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks.- slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the M1- will have to reduce the mids a bit via the Fuse editor.- although it has less overall sparkle, that also translates to smoother highs. I was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy. This is of course via the front panel only. I'm sure it can be done using the Fuse editor.3. It's supposed to be 7 lbs. heavier than the M1 but it sure doesn't feel like it. I keep looking at the M1 fiendishly wondering if there's a way to shoehorn a 12"" speaker in there.4. For the most part, the patches created in the M1 translated pretty well after the required firmware update, needing just a few adjustments here and there.5. I'm appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as I won't have to crank the bass control as much as I have to on the M1. That of course translates to more headroom for the power amp.More from editing via Fuse - here are a few of the things that I found and liked.- The 65 Deluxe model sounds better with the 57 Deluxe's Cab and vice versa. The 65 has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the 57's cab while the 57 model's propensity to break up sooner works better with the 65's less sparkly cab. The 57 also seems to have more low end girth.- The Twin is a bit too icepick-y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the Bassman's cab.- The SuperSonic's Cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds I use that have a bit more gain. It's good for keeping things from getting too buzzy. It's a very fat sounding Cab sim.- Both the M1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my Tex-Mex pickups. I have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet (my other guitar has mini humbuckers) but somehow I get the feeling that I won't like it as much as I do with the strat. I think this is understandable though. Since Fender has always been all about the single coils, I'm not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot on.So far, for 200 bucks... I couldn't ask for more."
1,5,"I passed on all the Fender G-Dec units for years,(still glad I did), instead buying the Line 6 Spyder Jam and then a Line 6 Spyder IV. They are both great amps for sure, but for the money, Fender has really got this one right.  The clean tones on this are just great. The ability to modify with FUSE is an additional layer of gravy.  The amp is just about perfect for bedroom, studio or practice. I bet more than a few of these quietly show up in Nashville studios...I still love my Line 6 units, especially my Spyder Jam cause I can play along with tracks, and I love the accuracy of the models in the Line 6 Spyder IV.  But if you are in the market for a great practice amp, or an amp that will take you from super clean to vintage dirty for special effects on a demo, Fender hits the mark on this one. It's just ridiculous what is in this for $199.I compared this to a VOX Valve modeling amp, not even a contest. Against a Spyder IV, individual tastes will vary.Only complaint is the ""stacking"" of the six effects onto just two knobs. But that is a minor complaint. Most people don't use chorus and flange at the same time anyway.If you are in the market for a cheap, reliable modeling amp that is less cost than a Digitec RP500 pedal, you owe yourself to look at this thing. Right now, it is the biggest bang for the buck. I only wish I had bought the Mustang III, but it was not available yet when I purchased."
1,5,"Was looking for a good solution to practice guitar at night while my 1 year slept. Before I was plugging in headphones to my amp head, but it was getting kind of annoying to set everything up (take out electric plug covers, get all cords out of the cabinets, etc). Oh how life changes with a baby! :)This little product is the perfect solution.It takes two AAA batteries (some generic brand are included in the package). There are two ON settings: regular ON and ""FX"" ON. Regular on is basically like a standard lead channel. Turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean. Crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch. Nothing heavy metal, but a nice crisp crunch. FX ON turns on a little delay effect. You can not adjust the delay effect, only turn it on or off. There are also knobs for volume and tone.Plug your headphones into the side, and you can also plug in an MP3 player on the top to jam with a backing track.VOX has samples for all of their AMPlugs on their website, however they seem to be missing samples for the Joe Satriani version. I would say that the JS version is pretty close to the ""LEAD"" amplug.I have a pair of middle/lower range headphones (Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Studio Monitor Closed-back Dynamic Stereo Headphones) and the amplug sounds fantastic.In the title I wrote ""wait for this to go on sale"" ... b/c of the JS branding, this particular amplug retails at a much higher price than the other amplugs. However, it frequently drops down to the same price level so keep your eyes peeled! Personally at the higher MSRP i dont think its worth it, but at the same price it is if you are looking for a nice lead tone."
1,5,"This is my 3rd VOX Amplug I have purchased through Amazon.  They are all awesome in thier own way.  The Satriani Amplug has very nice effects similar to a flanger and delay with reverb.  Without the effects on it is similar to the Lead plug with much lighter distortion - still has nice crunch to it though.  If you are a Satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining!  If you could only buy just one, this one may not be for you depending on what style music you like to play.  I love metal, rock, classic rock etc.The first song I played through this plug was 'The Star Spangled Banner' (ala Jimmi Hendrix) and wow, the Satch effects just make it sound amazing!  The Top Gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well.If you are looking for a pure distorted metal sound go for the Metal Amplug - it rocks your face off(I LOVE MINE). The AC30 Amplug is real nice for classic rock and country (it is nice and clean but can go into AC/DC tones) - very versatile Amplug.The Satch Amplug is a welcome addition to my collection...I would tell you to buy it, and if I lost mine I would replace it immediately.  Same with the Metal Amplug.  If I lost my AC30 Amplug I would wait for it to go on sale or something and pick up another -  as versatile as it is, I don't play enough classic rock or country as I do metal."
0,3,"I wanted this for overall practice however the only &#34;clear and good&#34; sound will be the satriani effect.if that is exactly what youre looking for get it for sure! it does work i loved the delay hoped it could be adjusted, it can't.still use it for practice and wont change it. its just hard to get a clean sound out of it."
1,5,"For those unfamiliar with Vox's amPlug products, these things are amazing.  I'm just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the 1990's, and they were mostly terrible.  What Vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers (which weigh virtually nothing, run for 10-15 hours on 2 AAA batteries, and plug directly into the guitar) is nothing short of amazing.  They have incredible amp-like tone and get as loud as you can possibly want.  Even through a pair of $20 Sony headphones, they sound amazing.  The star of the collection, in my opinion, is the Vox AC30 amPlug, which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to Top Boost overdrive.  If you haven't played an amPlug before, the AC30 one is $39.99 of the best money you'll ever spend.Now, getting to this specific Joe Satriani amPlug, it's impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself.  Fans of Joe Satriani (even casual ones) will recognize elements of this sound right away.  Satriani has a very distinctive sound, which he crafted over the years using a modified Boss DS-1 Distortion and (more recently) his Vox ""Satchurator"" Distortion Box.  It's a thick lead tone with a nice sustain, and colored with a delay effect.  Both of those elements are present on this signature amPlug.  You have a level control, a gain control, and a tone control.  There's also three switch positions: Off, On, and Fx.  The ""Fx"" position engages the delay effect, but the tone is otherwise the same.PROS:First, the price retails at $49.99, whereas most of the other models are $39.99.  (I believe the Lead amPlug is also $49.99 and also has a delay feature).  I think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money, but this is admittedly a sort of ""niche"" product.  Overall, however, you have several amPlugs to choose from, and if you choose this one, $49.99 is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone.  The tone has a real sweet spot between ""3"" and ""5"" that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes.  While it isn't necessarily and ""ideal"" rhythm guitar distortion, you can hit rich chords with nice sustain.  I prefer the tone on the higher gain levels, and you can really crank it up if you want to, but it sounds great at lower volumes too.  The delay is also surprisingly good - it's probably set to around the 400 milisecond gap, which is pretty standard.  Adds a cool echo ""fullness"" to your solo progressions, much like a classic Satriani solo.  Again, the overall tone is fantastic.  With the amount of gain provided, you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit (though I've always thought of Satch of more a technical, melodic guitarist than a ""metal"" guitarist).CONS:There are a few things to know about the Satriani signature model, but I don't think any of them should discourage you from checking it out.  While the delay is surprisingly good, you can't customize it.  You can't make the repeats shorter or longer, and you can't adjust the timing of the repeats.  Keep in mind that this is mostly a ""practice"" device for your personal use, however, and I still enjoy using the delay.  As for the tone, which I mostly discussed as a ""pro"" in the paragraph above, you should be aware that this is not meant to be a ""clean"" signal.  It is possible to get a somewhat clean tone by rolling back on the gain or lowering the volume of your guitar, but it's mostly distortion or bust.  The durability of all of the amPlugs has also been questioned by some.  The device is VERY lightweight and all plastic, except for the metal plug portion.  I don't doubt that you could bang it on something and break it quite easily.  The switches and dials may also fail over time.  But frankly, at $40 or $50, it's probably a better value than making it out of heavy duty metal and charging $100 for it, which would lock more people out of the market.  I would certainly buy another one (or several) if any of mine broke.  Finally, there as an audible ""hiss"" noise through your headphones anytime the device is on.  Slightly annoying when you're not playing, but I don't notice it at all once I start playing notes.THE VERDICT:One other ""dirty little secret"" to point out about these things: in addition to the Aux jack, which allows you to plug in an MP3 player and jam along, it is possible to use a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp, PA, or anything with speakers.  You might be surprised how good it sounds.As an after-note, I wrote most of this review playing on my Jackson DR6, which has two Seymour Duncan Humbuckers, and it sounded great.  I later tried it on a Gibson Les Paul (which is usually my primary guitar), and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers, it did not sound as good.  The distortion was much more ""fizzy"".  Haven't tried it with single coil pickups, but I think that it would likely work well with a Strat-type guitar due to the overall ""roundness"" of the tone.The amPlug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing, irrespective of their budget or living situation.  The Satriani model brings its own special character to the series, and if you like the tone as much as I do, might become an instant favorite."
1,5,Took it on vacation so I didn't have to leave my axe at home. Fit right in the guitar case with my headphones - got my practice and jamming in everyday with some good tone and effects. Worth the price and no lugging around a small amp just for practice on the go.
1,4,"It wasn't terrible for someone who was a beginner with electric guitars and amp but after a while, it becomes less and less useful."
1,5,This may be 10Watts but it can fill a big room with its sound. Not too heavy and very handy for traveling. This can't be used for concert or gigs but for use in private/family use or maybe inside a church. Built is good and the power of the sound is sufficient.
1,5,"This little dude weighs next to almost nothing. It gets loud enough as you need it in a bedroom (LOUD), don't expect to gig with it, and don't expect Marshall Tube quality, either. It does however, sound amazing!! It's clean, bright and loud. For metal it's got great control of the distortion tone, which sounds pretty good."
1,5,"A good solid piece of equipment with great tone and control! It came extremely well packed. For the price, this is one great little dynamo!"
1,5,Good basic first amp.  Great for practicing in the bedroom without bothering everyone in the house!  Compact size makes storage easy.
1,5,"Rogue G10 10W Guitar Combo Amp Black is good small amp for practicing.Actually, it's loud enoucht for home.Recommend it."
1,4,"I thought that this may be just a joke but it turns out that it's a nice little portable amp.Of course you can't drive it very hard or the distortion gets to be too much, but if you keepit low it works very nicely and the price makes it very attractive."
1,4,"I use the amp in my shop when testing out new guitar configurations (Pickups) on the flyand then if it sounds OK go to the big boys in my blues room.The amp will reach its max in short order, but again, for what it is and the price, it ishard to find an equal."
1,5,My son purchased this himself to go with his new guitar and he is thrilled with it.  The Amp works really well and he was thrilled with the price of it.  Great purchase.
1,5,A nice little amp to rock out with... So it may not be what professionals use or anything like that but it gets the job done which is all I asked.
1,4,a very recent purchase....I have not used it yet so I can't say much...however I have loaded the software on my laptop...the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling.....very good deal for newbies like me!!!
1,5,"Shipping was fast! Got to me in two days! And it's a great midi controller! I use it for fl studio to make beats, I just plugged it in and I set a timer to get good timing ratios for it and it installed in 8.6 seconds flat and when I went in fl studio and selected it and tried it out with some sound kits but it was slow recognizing like I'd press the keys and it wouldn't recognize right away, then I remembered the asio drivers weren't activated, then I activated them and every key I'd press it would recognize immediately! Great buy! I hope if y'all get one! It's great and making beats is so much easier now then pressing the keys on the regular computer keyboard!"
1,5,"I have a fully-weighted 88-key Alesis QS 8.1 and an M-Audio Axiom 61 semi-weighted and they're both fine when I'm just playing standalone or recording audio or MIDI. But I wanted something with a lighter touch for entering notation and experimenting with soft synth sounds, when my focus is more on writing and software than on playing, per se. The Alesis is perfect: I can grab keys effortlessly without feeling distracted by playing the keyboard 'correctly' - if that makes sense (it makes a clear difference to me).I opted for the 25 key strictly for space considerations and, while the down/up octave shift keys are easy and intuitive to use, I often wish I'd gone for a larger model to get wider voicings. I may trade it in for an upgrade at some point, but overall I'm very happy with the keyboard."
1,4,"First, keys are not my best instrument to play, just a beginner, I'm a professional guitarist. That said, I purchased this for my home recording studio. The controller that I had was a ION but had mini keys. I love the fact that this controller has full size keys. Works great with my Mac Book Pro and Logic Pro X. I know it's not the best controller but it's good if your on a limited budget."
0,2,"Could be a fluke, but my unit was defective straight out of the box.  Plugged it into the Macbook Pro, fired up GarageBand and right away it's MIDI connectivity was intermittent. Then it had some stuck notes.  Then it stopped being recognized at all.  It still got power from the USB bus, but no MIDI, no sound.  The jack was visibly wiggly, too.So, you're mileage may vary, but mine obviously had a defective USB port on the back.  Rather than bust it open and get soldering iron, I returned it and bought an M-Audio Oxygen 25 for $20 more."
0,2,"With drum pads, I basically either get 0 velocity, or max.  And I have to really hammer on them to trigger.  Hurts after a while.Likes:+ Size+ Assignable knobs.+ Works good w/ Ableton LiveDislikes:- Drum pads!Keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size.I'm looking to upgrade after a month.. Want better drum pads.  :-/"
0,1,Works as advertised but the keys are stiff. Pads take too much presure to activate. Nice that I dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.After the first few uses the USB socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless. Wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru Amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed. I had registered it with AKAI already so I complained to them and they sent me a new one. I had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.Not recommending this product.
0,3,First off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless. You have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response. The keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable. There is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs. HATE the mini USB jack since those connections rarely last. For this price it is a 'Do Not Recommend' for me.
0,1,This unit might be great if you have child hands - The KEYS ON THE  keyboard is soooo small..  Don't get this if you have Man hands! wtf U[DATE THE DESCRIPTION Akai WTF
0,3,"The size of this makes it awesome for carrying around and it all works great. I have it custom mapped for multiple softwares. I love the product and all the features for the price. My only problem is, is that the USB plug on the controller becomes lose very quickly after moderate use. This is actually a huge problem, once the plug stops working your out of a controller. I would recommend this controller for home use and to leave the plug in the controller and do touch unless you have to. When unplugging it just be careful and it'll last a lot longer. The price on amazon is awesome."
1,5,"I use this to record my band and other songs into garage band. Plugged right in, no drivers to install, computer recognized it immediately. I am missing out on a lot of this thing's capabilities by using it only in garageband, but for what I need it for, it's perfect. I use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks. I researched a ton before I bought this one. Touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys. I could have got a lot better midi controller, but for the money, this one suits my band's needs just fine."
1,5,"This is a really amazing portable Midi Keyboard. This is great for anyone wanting to create music while traveling. I've had no problems with it and the beat pads are really firm, but nice. You have to use a lot of pressure on the pads, but oh well. It is perfect. PLUS There are soo many settings and options to play with, as well as setting the knobs on the keyboard to do whatever you need it to do. Works amazing in FL Studio."
1,5,small and unobtrusive; just leave it there everytime you play. get in tune anytime you need to no matter what is going on around you.
1,5,"It tunes without any problems... and I love using the word ""SNARK""!! I thought the creaters could have implemented the ""clip"" feature I have seen on other tuners, which tunes through vibrations, but it still works great!!!!"
1,5,"This tuner looks nice, and works great. It puts guitars into the best tune. It has lasted for over a year and the battery hasn't died yet. Some might say it breaks easily but as long as it is dealt with gently there will be no problems. Great price, great tuner, worth the buy."
1,5,This tuner is great and well worth the $15 you will pay for it at most places but I've seen it as high as $30-35 and that is just a rip off.
1,5,I still love these things. I remember spending over $60 for a guitar tuner in the 80's and having to unplug from the amp to plug into the tuner to tune and then back to the amp with my guitar hanging round my neck. Now??? I just clip it and forget it till I need it and push it's little button. If I forget to turn it off it has an auto off feature if it detects no vibration for a while. A new batterry lasted me almost two years. My first tuner's battery it came with lasted over a year. Expect to pay $5 TO $6 for a replacement battery. My more recent Snarks are still running on original batteries.
1,4,"All I wanted was a simple tuner... that's what this is. If you just want something cheap and basic with only one button then this product is perfect. Pros: Works fast/accurate and can recognize full chromatic scale. Cons: Built with cheap plastic so it may break if continually dropped. Also, tends to get confused when there is interference from other instruments in a loud room. FYI: Snark makes more complex tuners(Which are actually cheaper on amazon) that also have 3 or 4 extra features."
1,4,"For this price, you owe it to yourself to get at least one of these little things, better yet, get one for each guitar you own.They're reliable and easy to use. And ACCURATE!!!You can mount these in such a way that the display points to be back of the headstock. That way, they're easy to read and don't screw up the look of your guitar.Why no 5 star review? Because they're battery eaters. The provided battery lasts for about a month, then starts dimming. Not cool. A rechargeable version would be good."
1,5,"Saw this sucker on my bass player's head, and got one a few days later. Not pitch perfect on the fly, but keeps you very close when on the run. Unbeatable value. Silent tuning, so on stage it's almost a must."
0,3,"My main complaint is that this tuner is only approximately accurate.  It also occasionally fails to register at all.  I've tried putting in slightly different positions on the head of my guitars, but the contact is sporadic.  I A/B ed the Snark against two other tuners, and the snark fails to show notes that are a little flat and sometimes shows false sharp readings.  The other two tuners agree with each other and sound right to my ear.  Most people like this tuner, and on the plus side I also liked its convenience and the ease with which the results can be read.  Unfortunately my copy did not nail the pitch."
1,5,Easy to use.  I can tune while in a sea of people or other musical background.  This is definitely more accurate than a person's ear while other instruments are playing.
1,5,"As you can tell by the title, I've got another of these little babies.  Snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright, clear and works great."
1,4,"Other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50-150 and more.  I just wanted a decent simple pedal that could be used on occasion with my garage band buddies.  This is perfect.  I've only used a few times so I can't testify to the durabilty, but it sounds great.  Does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal."
1,5,"First, let me tell you what this pedal can't do.  It won't do long delays.  So, if you're into the sound of The Edge from U2 or David Gilmour, look for something else.  Expect to shell out over a hundred dollars for a delay pedal with lots of knobs and switches that are more versatile.  But if you just need a slapback delay or just a touch of ambience, this pedal will not disappoint!  Analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic.  Users of MXR Carbon Copy swear by them.  But for around $30, the Rogue pedal will get you close, minus the longer delay time.  I've read in some guitar forums that these are the same as the Belcat and Modtone boxes.  The pedal itself looks sturdy, made out of metal.  Compared to my digital delay, the Rogue sounded warmer, although my other delay has a switch for ""echo"" that made it warmer too.  This pedal sounded good and I have no complaints.  I don't use a long delay time, in fact, I don't max it out.  I only use about 75-80 percent.  Before judging this pedal, please experiment on it's placement on your pedal board.  The user manual advises you to put it before the distortion but unfortunately, it doesn't sound good on my rig.  Placing after the distortion pedal sounded better.  However, everytime I use the dirt channel of my Traynor YCV40, the tone gets muddy.  Now it's in the effects loop just like my other delay.  The sound has better definition.  It might sound different on your amp but at least try placing it before the distortion, then after the distortion and finally, the effects loop in your amp.  Ultimately, you and your gear will have the last say.  Overall, a good deal for the price.  I'm thinking of setting up a smaller board of 4 inexpensive pedals for that grab and go situation where my big board will be too cumbersome.  And if anything goes wrong, I can easily replace the pedals (Joyo, Rogue, Mooer).  Play on!"
1,5,I have had this pedal for a while and prefer it to my boss dd7 and the anolog is much more natural sounding. Its said that its not actually an anolog pedal however I think it does a good job at mimicking anolog sound. Ive played guitar and bass for over 10 years and had a few decent pedals in that time. I might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound. great pedal.
1,5,"I wanted a delay pedal but I'm not playing for big money so I had to watch the $$$ I spent. I read the reviews on the lower dollar pedals and decided on the Rogue. I haven't had much time to REALLY play with it, but trying it out has been fun and I expect it will do the job for me!"
1,5,"I have countless delay pedals and racks. This inexpensive delay is very special. It has the tone and mojo of an analog delay. It won't give you a thousand features but it will get you close to that rich vintage analog delay tone that many of us are looking for. It sounds great clean or dirty. it's a relatively short delay, which is great for many genres. Long delays are generally unusable except for very short passages at the end of a phrase or surreal Eric Johnson like music. I would qualify this as a working musicians delay that can be used in the studio and in a live environment. It's bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard, to your music. Pair it with a nice fuzz or overdrive and you'll be near the dark side of the moon. Many musicians use two delay pedals. I know, I often do. This one is my main delay and my 2nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage. Both work together to help me find the tones that I am searching for. The unit itself seems sturdy and well made. I use carbon zinc batteries in mine. They just seem to sound better to my ears. Keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time.True bypass and no hiss. Great surprise as I never took Rogue seriously. Never thought it'd be my goto pedal."
1,4,"The Rogue Analog Delay is well-constructed and feels very high quality given the price.  It's similar in size to an MXR stompbox, though the knobs are more reminiscent of a BOSS.  Delay is a very simple effect that is increasingly available on modeling amplifiers to cheap plastic entry-level pedals.I really have no complaints about the Analog Delay in terms of how it performs and sounds.  It does a good job of creating that ambient short delay sound up to about 320ms, or slapback rockabilly on quicker repeats.  It's just too bad that they weren't able to stretch out the delay time a little longer, perhaps to 450ms or 500ms.  Once you get into that territory, there's a much broader array of things you can play, including the U2-style phrasing repeats.  That being said, a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway.But it isn't fair to compare this pedal to an MXR Carbon Copy, and if you're looking for something cheap and surprisingly high-quality to provide ambiance, the Rogue will do just fine."
1,5,"you can never have too many delays, so i pulled the trigger.  i was shocked at how good it sounds, not just &#34;for the money&#34; but over all.  it's won a spot on my pedalboard, and i'm picky."
1,5,"I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the guitar when I was thinking about buying it, but I read all the review on it and decided to give a shot.  I figured for the price ($39.99 in late Nov 2012) that it wouldn't be a big deal if it was a crap guitar because I bought it to play around with while I visit my family in CA.  When I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised!The guitar came in great shape.  It was packed well and didn't have any damage on it.  The top fret on the fretboard has some extra glue on it, but it doesn't affect the performance of the guitar.  It came with an allen wrench to adjust the trust rod and once I lowered the action on the guitar, it was much easier to play.The sound is excellent even with the strings they provide which seem like medium weight.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.  It sounds as good or better as my old school ovation that cost three times as much.  The pick guard looks a bit cheap, but that's just nitpicking.If you want a cheap guitar that sounds great, I totally recommend this one.  I am extremely happy with this purchase."
1,4,"Sounds pretty good. Great for the price. New to guitars, but in 24hrs. it loses tune by a whole note in a few strings."
1,5,"I have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100. I have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and I also have some cheapies. Some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the ""Cheapies"" I've been dealing with Musician's friend forever. Rogue is Musician's Friend's brand. Music 123 is a Musician's Friend affiliate and they also sell Rogue guitars. I have several different models of Rogue guitars and I'm impressed with all of them. The Rogue RA-090 is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the Fender Starcaster. Here's the good part, the Rogue is about half the price of the Fender! Many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one. Once they realize it's not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers,they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten. If you're not sure if you're serious about learning to play, this is the guitar for you. Even if you're an intermediate to advanced player, you still can't go wrong with this guitar. It has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument. The finish and workmanship is also like what you'd find on a more expensive guitar. They look, play and sound great! Many people tend to shy away from Rogue guitars because of the low price. They figure a guitar that cheap can't be much good. That's where they're wrong! You have to actually play one to understand what I'm talking about. Once you play a Rogue guitar, you too, will become a believer. This is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire. If it happens to get damaged or stolen you're not out an arm and a leg. I love Fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites, but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar, the Rogue is a much better value than the Fender and equal if not better in quality. The Rogue RA-090 comes in a variety of color choices. If or when you decide to sell it, you can usually get back what you paid for it.I give Rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one. I've been playing guitar for 51 years so I should know what I'm talking about. I do not own stock in Musician's Friend, Music 123, or Rogue guitars and I don't get paid to endorse them. This review is my honest opinion."
1,5,Good string action out of the box. Nice looking full size guitar with adjustable truss rod and good sound deep tone.
1,5,"I have played it with the strings it came with and as a guitarist for 20 years I can attest to the fact that this is a great practice guitar or for taking to the James river. I used to take my $700 Ibanez electric acoustic down to that river and it was sometimes a scary thing. The Ibanez is heavy where this Rogue is light as a feather and it did not cost a lot of money. I want at least one more of these to carry around with me everywhere I go. When it dies i will buy another one. You cannot use this for performance of any kind, but for yourself, friends and family around the campsite or wherever, it is perfect!"
1,5,"I've only recently heard of Joyo pedals, and that's because Amazon.com kept recommending them to me.  I normally stick with BOSS pedals - they sound good, and they're all the same size, so they're easy to set up/maintain.  This pedal was priced very well ($32), and had nearly a 5 star rating.  I used to have a BOSS Phaser (I don't recall which number off the top of my head.)  It was a pretty complex little pedal, and sounded great, but I needed money and sold it.  When I saw this pop up in my Amazon, I got curious, did some research, and decided it would be a wise investment.  Sure enough, it was!  It's obviously simple to use, having one knob and all.  Over all, the pedal sounds great, and seems to be very well made.  Based on this experience, I'm very much interested in checking out their chorus, flanger and overdrive pedals.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive, simple yet well-made and great sounding phaser!"
1,4,"I just got this pedal so I don't know how it will hold up over a  long period of time. But on first play it pleasantly surprized me. It does give you some of the way out sounds other pedals my give, but it does provide a gradual increase in phase as you turn the one knob. Mine came with a 9 volt in it but you can also use a adapter. Useful tones at dollar store price= good deal"
1,5,"I'm really happy with this pedal.  Give a good phase sounds like Waylon would use.  Simple to use, one knob and it doesn't boost or reduce the signal"
1,5,"I bought this as i had already purchased tow other Joyo pedals just to see what the buzz was about.This phaser is perfect.  I do not use a dramatic effect, more or an EVH setting for leads.  This pedal is 99.8% sounding like the MXR.  I never give anything a 100%.  This is a a great phase pedal, great tone and a great price.  I am done thinking a good pedal must cost $200 and above.  This was like $35 and sounds awesome!"
1,4,"This is as much a reply to the guy who wants to hear from people who have had this for more than a week as it is a review for prospective buyers. I've used it for 8 months with no issues at all. It sounds great, it works perfectly and it was $40. As for quality control, I have several Joyo pedals, and I can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome. I've never used a Phase 90, so the ""clone"" factor was a moot point when I purchased the Joyo Vintage Phaser. It works, it's simple to use and I had money left over to buy more gear. I've been playing for 29 years and I highly recommend Joyo pedals. If you don't like it, get a refund. It's not rocket surgery."
1,5,"Classic TubeScreamer tone at 1/4 the price..what's not to love? One of my most used pedals, great for over driving a clean tone amp.  I'd definitely buy it again.  Construction isn't great but at $40 who cares"
0,1,"A dull, inept version of a TubeScreamer. Just sounds flat and boring. Not very inspiring. At all. (Then again, I never did really like TS's)......."
1,5,"Been playing for 30 years and I have used tube screamers extensively. As some of the other reviewers have noted this is basically a tube screamer clone without the annoying midrange hump which some people complain about.  It is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components.  Most importantly it sounds quite good especially when you take into account that it cost a bit over 30 dollars. Are there better tube screamer clones out there? Probably but for the price you  will not find a better unit.  Build sturdy, I would gig with this without hesitation.I hate to leave this review because I know the prices will go up on the joyo stuff as more people are tuned into these products. Great pedal. Great value."
0,1,"Really wanted to like this one, because I loved the price. There is no way this is true bypass. The one I got was defective out of the box, and so when I checked, I saw the circuitry did not support pass through.  Maybe it is because I received a defective one, but I still wouldn't try this brand name. I am now stuck saving up for a Full Tone or something."
1,5,"This is a lot of overdrive goodness for not a lot of money.  Mine has the older paintjob with the monkey on it, which makes it sound infinitely better IMHO lol.  This is intended to be used with a tube amp to achieve breakup and it does that job very nicely. Those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere.  You can't blame a chicken for not quacking properly.  It plays nicely with other pedals and can be used to boost another dirtbox for when you've reached the part of Freebird that we've all been waiting for. The build quality is decent for the price and it claims true bypass thought I haven't looked under the hood.  Regardless of whether it's 'TRUE' or 'buffered', it doesn't color my sound when it's off.  Truth be told, I kind of prefer my Behringer TO800 tonewise- more of a personal preferance in the way I prefer Pepsi to Coke but still drink both - but the TO800 pedal isn't true bypass and the build is much more flimsy on that one. I think that if you are addicted to OD/FUZZ boxes like I am you should grab one of these for your toolbox.  If you aren't a hoarder of dirtboxes but you are just looking for a very nice tubescreamer on the cheap you can't go wrong with this one.  You can handpaint the cover with an owl or whatnot and tell your cork-sniffer bandmates that you spent an arm and a leg on it.  They will be none the wiser.  I think enough of this pedal/company that I just ordered the JF-02 OCD clone and will probably grab the Octive Fuzz when my wife isn't looking - though if one more pedal comes into the house this month I may be strangled in my sleep !"
1,5,30 bucks is better than 179 for the tube screamer from Ibanez and the sound is very similar based on youtube.  I use this on the clean channel of my Bugera V22 tube amp and it makes my guitars sound like they should.  Awesome with my LTD VC-401 with 59 and JB pickups.
1,5,"Yep, I said it, BETTER than a Tubescreamer.This pedal has a wider gain range, far wider tone range and is much quieter than my mid 80s 'screamer.The only thing it seems to lack is the &#34;smooth creaminess&#34; of an old 808, but I can easily live with that..This is an amazing TS clone, and for the price, cant be beat."
1,5,I'm no audiophile but this thing is just as good as my BBE Green Screamer. It's perfect and I would suggest getting one before the cost goes up.
0,2,"I honestly was not impressed. It looked Cheap, sounded cheap, what else is there to say, you get what you pay for!!! Another Chinese copy of a tubescreamer,"
1,4,"I don't know if it lives up to all the hype and mystical powers of the all-mighty vintage tube screamers of Ibanez, but it is an exact clone including the same component values, potentiometers, ICs (JRC), etc.For proof that it is exactly the same, I was able to modify it for different frequency response (corner frequency), and add asymmetrical clipping with the exact same components in exactly the same spot in the circuit as seen in TS9 mods. Of course the board is layed out a little differently.The only reason I gave it 4 (really 4.5) stars was because it does produce some noticeable noise (hiss) at higher gains, but this is expected given the boosting stage acts like a high pass filter (this gives it the characteristic mid-range boost). It can be cut with the tone control, but it also may have been due to a poorly shielded amplifier, and or a one-spot power adapter."
1,4,"If you need an 808 Clone on the Cheap this is your pedal. Don't be fooled though, it does not school the classic Tube Screamer but it holds its own. This was a main staple on my pedalboard until I found a great deal on a Bad Monkey and then sadly it came off. I was not looking to replace it at the time, it just happened the Bad Money did what I needed it to do better.I recommend this pedal to everyone and anyone who needs an 808 but has the budget of your average gigging musician :).Maxon 808 $150.00Ibanez TS9 $100Joyo Vintage OD $50"
1,5,"This is a really nice, sturdy pedal with a really warm tone. I have a Marshall MG15CFX solid state amp. This pedal sounds really good on the clean channel, but you can hear that it is not designed for a solid state dirty channel. It has given me another tool in my toolbox and basically added a 5th channel to my 4 channel Marshall. Great classic rock 70's tone! It responds really well to my pick attack. You really can't go wrong for the money."
1,5,"I agree with the others here, this joyo is just a plain and simple OD just like so many others but at a fraction of the price. I put my pedals through three tests, 1) playing alone, 2) Playing at rehearsal, and 3) gigs. This thing stands up nicely on all three. Using it with Am Sp Tele, Hiway 1 Strat, Squier 51, Epi LP Spec w/p/90 and Fender BJ, Peavey Classic 30/50. Sounds amazing in any combo. Giggin musician for over 20 years for what its worth."
1,5,"outstanding pedal and an outstanding company to deal with (hossen). the pedal is everything i expected from it ..and a little more. Good crunch, nice light distortion when you want it, and it is not at all midrange sounding like a tube screamer. A definite improvement on a classic stompbox. Nice work Joyo and hossen for making me a happier guitarist."
1,4,"In my opinion, this thing is well worth the price. Gives great overdriven tube amp sound / versatile for 95% of music - not for bone-crushing metal. The knobs work fine but do not seem to roll-off or not very sensitive / precise. . . full range achieved from 6 to noon."
1,5,I swear this sound just ass good if not slightly better then my ole ts-9 tube screamer. You wont regret this purchase
1,5,"Awesome pedal, I love the joyo pedals, they don't break the bank and sound awesome. Glad I bought this pedal"
1,5,"I wanted to add to my pedal arsenal, but I didn't have the big bucks to spend on a Tube Screamer. So, I took a chance on this little stomp-box from China.  It compares itself to the TS, right on the box, and for good reason.  They use the same chip. More importantly, the construction is solid, good looking, and takes up minimal pedal-board space.  The on-off switch seems a little chintzy, but the tone that comes out of this thing is awesome. I only found that out after replacing the dead battery that it comes with, and plugging in to a power supply (not provided with unit).  It turned my partscaster into a blues making machine. It's responds well to your technique, and you can make it so funky, you can smell it!  It truly does have true bypass, and logical controls.  I don't have A TS to make direct comparisons, but for the money, this little pedal gives me exactly the tone I want.  And I saved about 70 or 80 bucks.  Ba-Da Bing!"
1,5,"There is no shortage of ""Tubescreamer clones"" on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues, jazz, and rock.  The DigiTech Bad Monkey is one such example.  But the Chinese-made Joyo JF-01 Vintage Distortion just be the best, and it's half the price of a TS-9.About the manufacturer - Joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor (very similar to an MXR in size and switch) but ""cloning"" the circuitry of well-known classic and modern boutique effects pedals.  Some people jump to conclusions about Chinese products, but don't just take it from me - do your homework.  The response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive, and there are great vendors/distributors within the U.S. that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days.  I'm definitely a fan of Joyo products.As for the ""Vintage Distortion"" itself, people have said it's based on either a TS-9 or the (more expensive) TS-808.  Frankly, while the latter is apparently warmer (and less mid-range heavy) than the former, I'm not sure there's any significant difference.  I played this JF-01 side by side with my TS-9, and it's probably one of the more exact ""clones"" in the Joyo lineup.  For example, the Joyo ""Ultimate Drive"" is an excellent (higher-gain) overdrive pedal based on a Fulltone OCD, but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there (some of which are arguably BETTER than the original).  With the settings matched, the JF-01 performed almost exactly like the TS-9 in level, gain, and tone.  There probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full, which isn't a bad thing.  It's very responsive to your playing style and, again, it sounds like a Tubescreamer.I'll probably be keeping my Tubescreamer, if only because it's an iconic pedal that performs well.  But it's superior in name only - if I had to use the Joyo Vintage Overdrive in its place, I'd be no worse for the wear.  5 stars, highly recommended!"
1,5,"The issue isn't whether it sounds exactly like a &#34;Tube Screamer&#34;, the issue (for me at least) is, does it sound good? Is it musical? Does it sound like an overdriven amp?I say it does. It sounds great for blues and rock. I've only had it for a couple weeks and I hope that it continues to work well for a long time. I've heard that these can be fragile, but I'm pretty gentle with my gear. If it breaks, I'll post about it."
1,4,"I ended up returning it and bought a cheaper generic model as the other one has better effect for less than half the price.  This unit is of high quality, though."
1,5,"One of the the best lights I own. Small but fills a gym with light for under $100, what more could you ask? As the other reviewers boast, this is a great unit and I hope it lasts a long, long time."
1,5,"Great laser, nice big fat stars, red and green, worth the money.  Point it at the ceiling or on the wall behind me.  Great effect."
1,4,"Despite being so small, it will fill most rooms Completely! These are lasers! You can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver. The patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace. I haven't tested the sound-feature but I've seen it on videos. I recommend this to anyone want to be entertained!"
1,5,"This is the American DJ Micro Galaxian red & green laser. It is the smaller version of the Galaxian laser with the same laser power output, but a smaller beam spread. It is a compact well built unit with a power switch on the back and a small fan to keep it cool. The small power cord plugs into the back of the unit and has a transformer block on the end of the cord. It comes with a remote that works great, but has an antenna to pull up if needed, which seems like old technology. The remote has 4 buttons which allows you to select auto/sound mode, blackout, color and direction of rotation. When going through the color modes you can select red, green, red/green together or red/green changing and flashing. You can select auto mode or sound mode so it will go with the music. There is also a speed control knob on the back of the laser to have the dots stop completely, move very fast or slow. The darker the room the better, but you can easily see it in any room with the lights on. I am very pleased with it. I havent tried it with fog but I know it would look great since it has 200 beams. It will work great for any DJ to use on the dancefloor, wall or ceiling. This is a great buy under $100.PROS: It is small, bright, well built and works great. It has a remote to control it.CONS: Transformer on cord and antenna on remote."
1,5,"Only used it a couple times so far but I like it. I like how it glides onto the strings of my acoustic guitar. As someone else mentioned it's hard to get the cloth back into the clear plastic bag inside the lid, though. But otherwise I think it's great. I like how it smells (does that make me strange?)."
1,4,its really good i like the idea of covering all the strings width and easily applying but the point its dried fast
1,5,"I tried this about 3 months ago. I use Fender 150L's and with it the longevity doubles. I play every day and gig one or two nights. They normally go dead in a week or less. I just did my 3rd weekend with the same set. I put it on when necessary on gig breaks. After practicing, I wipe down the strings first with a cloth and fretboard, then I put the Slick on. Next day, it's not so oily that it bothers me since I don't care for that oily feeling. I just ordered 2 more of these. Obviously, I think it a good product.Update about 2 years later: I won't do without these. They are part of my rig and I always have an extra at home in case it is time to change. They also last quite a long time, maybe 7 months."
1,5,"Purchased this for my son who plays both Acoustic and Electric guitars. He's absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner! Great buy, prompt shipping, great product!"
1,5,"Open cap, rub across strings a few times.  Basically, you're done.  If you want to take a lint free cloth and clean each string after one glide over, that works well too. Doesn't leave the strings oily or full of residue.  I will probably clean my guitar strings every time I play now!"
1,5,It was great to get quality Christmas gifts that my son was pleased with. The budding musician in our home was glad to receive this item as we do not have a music store in our town. So thanks to Amazon for making this possible.
0,3,"This was a precent decent product, I was able to use it to clean the strings on all my guitars and it worked well but the cloth that comes with it was really cheap so when you wipe down the strings, it starts to break down and leave a lot of lint behind and pieces of it get caught in the strings and frets.  Otherwise, besides that, the cleaner itself is great.  I just have to use another cloth to wipe it down afterwards and pick off the lint that gets caught in the strings and frets."
0,3,"Is kind of good, i mean it does clean the strings and oils them a little bit, tending to sound better for more time and last longer.You just get sort of bored of forget to do it every time so I'm not sure if it was worth the purchase. But is a good product.Recommended"
1,5,Using the string cleaner on a regular basis helps to prolong string life and keeps your guitar sounding bright and full. A repeat buy!
1,5,"This really cleans your strings. It's fast with a couple of swipes and a lint free towel strings are clean. It comes with a little towel inside the cap but not very efficient, ok if you need it quick somewhere else. Not worth knocking it down for a little towel so I'm sticking with the 5 star!"
1,4,I got this to help clean my strings after constant playing to help preserve them and keep them from having oils from my fingers cause them to fail.  Saves some money on replacements...I found another product that actually gets the top and bottom for a better cleaning of the strings so I like it better as far as the whole purpose of cleaning the strings.  I use this to apply my cleaner to the fingerboard now for a deeper cleaning.
0,2,"I can't say much about this product.  I tried it twice.  It seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings, but I really didn't notice any great change.  The strings didn't sound betteer or brighter.  Now, it sits in my drawer and collects dust.  Maybe I will try it again at some point, but...."
1,5,This is an even easier sting cleaner than the round tin cleaner that's been around. It's better because it cleans all 6 at once.
0,3,"The Fender slick string cleaner works great when it is brand new. The great part about it is the design. The fact that it is wide enough to run along all six strings is a definite plus. The things I don't like about it is the top does not close tight enough and can come off during any kind of travel. Once the top is off or just not closed properly, the pad dries out and then it is useless. Also, the little cloth that comes with it is almost impossible to fit back inside the container once you have opened it. As stated it was really good at cleaning and was easy to use but I was only able to use it once because the top came off and it dried out. Unfortunately because of that I would not recommend this item. Go with the Fast Fret."
1,4,"I agree with the others - I've been using Fast Fret for over 20 years (and Finger Ease spray for over 40), but I believe Slick is a better product.  I give it just 4 stars, though, due to its design. The wiping cloth that comes with Slick is meant to fit in a small plastic ziplock bag inside the cap, but it's difficult to get the cloth back inside the small bag, and it's bulky inside the cap, making it a little difficult to close with the cloth inside the cap. It would be easier to close if the cap side was deeper; the way it's designed now, the cap and the applicator are equally sized, when they needn't be. That's a small gripe, though - if I could give it 4-1/2 stars (with half a star off for the design), I would - it's great stuff."
1,5,"Easy to use.  Wide enough to cover all six strings in one pass.  Little to no excess residue.  Handy to use package, pull the cover off, swipe the strings, put the cover back on.  I have not noticed any effect on the tone quality or sustain of my strings."
1,4,"I requested and received one of these as a Christmas gift, then bought another so I could keep the first one at a weekend place where I keep a guitar. It works quickly and easily to swipe on the strings, and keeps strings clean and rust-free (important here in humid Florida) and strings last longer than they did before I started using this even though I've always wiped the strings with a soft cloth after each use.I keep my Slick string cleaner in a quart size ziploc-type bag because it's not airtight when you snap it together and I don't want it to dry out. I hope when it does dry out that I can just add some juice to rejuvenate it. I just don't know what kind of liquid to use. I don't want to drop $8 or so for a new one every time it dries out. Any ideas are welcome, please add a comment to this review if you can help me out.Bottom line, it extends the life of my strings and that's always good."
0,1,"I honestly don't see the purpose.  It doesn't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar.  I've used it a few times, but don't see the benefit.Edit 5/30/13:After coming back to read the other reviews, it's obvious what happened:  This was shipped to me completely dry.  There was no grease/lubricant qualities.  It was like a dry erase pad.  They need to improve their quality control.  I'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star.  They HAVE to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.I would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn't dried out yet, to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out."
1,5,This is the best string cleaner I have owned to date and I have owned about all of the rest. The way it is packaged makes it super easy to pop the lid and apply it. The casing is tough enough to be thrown into my gig bag and carried all over without the lid coming off or the case breaking. The 'other' string cleaner that is a bottle with cloth applicator spills out and the cloth wears out too fast - then leaves cloth pieces on the strings. This product does not waste the cleaning agent - it applies evenly and there is NO cloth residue left on the strings to pick off. The cleaning agency works so well - it looks like I have cleaned a BBQ grill when I wipe my strings down. Amazing how dirty the strings get after just a few hours of play - this product will get that gunk off. I am done looking for a better string cleaner because this product has the best cleaner in the best packaging for travel. Well done Fender!
1,5,While this is not a $300 tape delay...it's a solid pedal that gets it done. It's way better built than other pedals in this price range. I'm sold. I've purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals.
1,4,"Does everything you'd expect it to do, as well as a couple of things you might not like.First, when run before the amp, it adds a bit of treble to the tone, and a hint of distortion.Not to the point of being unusable, but you guys playing with the &#34;Fender clean&#34; tone might notice. I certainly did.Playing with overdrive or distortion makes this issue unnoticeable, as you would imagine.Ive noticed that when using the pedal in an effects loop, the treble boost / distortion isnt there, or at least not noticeable. In my experience, of course, YMMV.Those are minor complaints though, as the pedal works well, has more than adequate delay times (up to 600ms) and is built well.I strongly suggest using this with a 9v adapter, because this pedal will eat a 9v battery in a matter of minutes.Overall its a great deal. No, its not as pristine a delay as a Carbon Copy or Boss DD, but its a fraction of the cost of those pedals, and I doubt anyone but you will notice the difference."
0,3,"I purchased this pedal with good expectations. However, my expectations were dashed at the constant popping every time the peadl was engaged. I tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained. Overall the pedal sounded descent for a $30 pedal but I could not handle the frustration. I traded and another joyo for a Ibanez stereo chorus."
1,5,"This is a very good quality, nice sounding delay. You can get that classic ""slapback"" sound or dial you in some nice lead delays for that classic rock sound. Very simple to operate and that's what makes these Joyo pedals a ""joy"" to use. Nothing fancy, but simple and to the point. Another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely ""true bypass"". I have bought the cheaper, ""plastic"" pedals and they make noise. They say that they are true bypass, but they are not. These babies are dead quiet! I run mine through the effects loop on my Bugera V22 tube amp and it sounds great! I also own the Joyo Vintage OD (TubeScreamer clone) and it is great as well. Highly recommend!!!"
1,5,I've tried a lot of delay pedals and this delay is easy to use- the sound is clean and crisp - easy to dial in-
1,5,"I've gotten a number of these Joyo and Artec pedals now, most from Earth City Sound(TX, mostly on eBay these days) though I recommend this seller on prompt delivery but don't happen to know much about them otherwise.I got this one on a whim just to have a second delay. I've had the DigiTech X-Series multi-delay for many years. The fun thing this Joyo does besides standard adjustable delay is that it makes crazy UFO, sci-fi-ish sounds. All one has to do is get a note or feed back going and simply experiment with noise by tweaking the knobs. Guitarists who are fans of Yo La Tengo and similar groups, spacey stuff will dig this box. Solid hardware, side mount ac power. Goofy graphics of an eagle though I imagine by now they've updated it's look."
1,5,"50+ years giggingowned it all 4 or 5 times :)wanted a cheap delay pedal to go into the fx loop of a newly purchased blackstar ht 5c r.since i've purchased several joyo pedals in the last year i looked for a joyo digital delay.it works perfectly, doesnt color the sound, silent switching and the knobs give all the control you'd ever need. it's well built and i expect it to last longer than me :)i highly reccomend this delay pedal."
1,5,"In my opinion Snark makes the best tuners in the 10 to 20 dollar price range. This particular model has a metronome built in to it, the metros options are a bit limited and the beat can be lost if you are in a noisy environment but for the price I consider I bought a tuner with a freebie built in.The tuner obviously works on mic alone so if the noise level gets too high or the note too soft it doesn't register but for my use (holding my fakebook open while I play mando and harmonica) it works well."
1,4,"I bought this not for the tuner, but because I needed a metronome.However, I had to give the tuner a try as well. With my trustySnark SN-1 Tunerattached to my guitar's headstock and this Snark SN-4 on the table, I proceeded to tune my guitar. I was impressed that both tuners were showing identical tuning even down to the fluctuations as the note rang out.As a metronome, I don't know what kind of frills others may offer but this does everything I need to keep in time.I only have one minor complaint. You can't view the Snark SN-4 at any kind of sharp angle. You need to view it head on. If you place it on your music sheet stand, that's great. But if it's not facing you, or lying flat on a desk, you may have trouble reading the screen. An integrated flip out kick-stand would make this perfect."
1,5,"I have Snark uke and guitar head mounted tuners, see my reviews.  When I use my music stand, I just want something in front of me that does not need mounting that also does a great job.  This is that device.I leave it on my stand, and can hit the silver front mounted button with one finger, and it's on, and I can play my ukulele and it will register and provide the same clear electronic dial and acurate tuning of the Snark head tuners.  In addition, this one has a metronome.  I like this very much, and may well buy another.Enjoy!"
1,4,"This product has a quiet metronome; in a playing environment, it won't be easy to hear. The tuner works on a mic, and that too will be easily overwhelmed in a social environment.That said, it's lovely to see the strings ""true in."" Makes even first tune-up easy. This accuracy will greatly help to tune the student's ear, making ""by-ear"" tuning possible sooner.Pretty nice. Hate the color.  Oh well."
1,5,"This tuner works well for all my acoustic instruments that I can't plug into a tuner. Banjo, guitar, mandolin, alternate tuning, even has a metronome for timing practice.Great product, great price."
1,5,"The tuner doesn't require you to hear either it or the guitar or bass to tune it, so it will work pretty well in a noisy/social environment. Overall, works just fine."
1,5,does what i wanted it to do and what they said it would do. works well with my stuff. recommend
1,5,This is definately worth the money. I was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all. Bought another one for my friend!
1,5,"I love the way this tuner works, with a bright screen and easy to use controls. The metronome feature is also a nice addition. It's a bit lightweight, making it seem like it wont last very long if even dropped once, but it hit the floor many times on me already and it's still going strong :-) This is a great tuner at an even better price, try it out and see for yourself!"
1,4,It works well with several different instruments that I have. Makes tuning a lot easier and accurate. It is a good value.
1,5,I bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner. These are the best tuners for the money. The display is very stable and it's simply fun and easy to use.
0,3,its ok for a bedroom amp its has a weird buzz that goes away when you touch any thing metal on the guitar even if the vol is all the way down and no its not the guitar i have plug it into other amps and no buzzing and it really dont like florescent lights im thinking about sending it back
1,5,"I hooked up my mic and my guitar pickup and it sounds good.  I haven't had much chance to play it, but so far so good.  It seems like it is good quality."
1,4,"This amp is a quality item for the dollar range (I paid $49.99).  There is some question about sound quality and variation in quality.  We purchased two of these, and one arrived with some minor issues, constant humming regardless of volume or EQ settings.  Amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem.This is not a 6000W stage amp, nor is it so quiet enough to practice without disturbing the neighbors...it has a full punch output at full gain/volume, and can easily light up a back yard.Specs-Input: 1/4"" Mono (not a tip and ring jack)Controls: Volume/Gain and selectable Volume 3-EQ range knobs.  There are two volume controls, once for each side of the push button selector.Outputs: 1/4"" Mono (for monitor or mixer), 1/4"" Dual Mono Headphone jack (tip and ring supplied from the same mono channel).Power:  Lighted front panel rocker switchThe box is very slim and small, about a foot by a foot and 8"" deep, the rear is partially open, speaker exposed, and allows for cord storage.Pros--Portability, easy of use and set up.-Quality finish (leatherette with steel corners) and good construction, 6"" heavy duty lead guitar speaker-Excellent sound and electronics for ANY amp under $100.  There are other manufacturers that have small wattage amps and smaller speakers that are $30-$50 more.  Go with this one.Cons--Units run hot and cold as to quality, but if it works out of the box, it's good, if not, you'll know it as soon as you power it up. Buy with confidence at Amazon from Amazon and you shouldn't have any worries.These amps power two Squier(tm) by Fender electric guitarsSquier by Fender Bullet Strat with Tremolo Bundle with Strings, Pick Card, and Polishing Cloth - Black, Rosewood Fretboardand do a great job.Other accessories for the beginner electric to consider:Cords -Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft,Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable, 10 feetStrap -Planet Waves Polypropylene Guitar Strap, BlackStraplocks -Dunlop Dual Design Straplok System, NickelHanger -String Swing Hardwood Home & Studio Guitar Hanger (Shades May Vary)"
1,5,"This is my first amp, which I am using with my new Applause AE148-RRB Acoustic Electric Guitar (also purchased from Amazon).  The guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp.  My only complaint is that as a first time amp owner/user I needed a bit more help on how to adjust the settings and this product came with NO paperwork at all.  Not sure if that is normal or if it was just omitted from the unit I received.  I downloaded the users manual from the Pyle website but it was also not much help.  But just by trying different settings I have managed to find what, for me, is the &#34;sweet spot&#34; for my guitar when paired with this amp.  Very happy with the amp and also happy that I spent the extra few dollars to get the 60 amp rather than the 30 amp version."
1,5,If your looking for the best.quality smaller.practice amp this is the amp for u it's definitely high quality its got.10 watts and overdrive and anything else u would need on a practice amp.definitely the best amp in this.price range i would.definitely.recommend it
1,5,"Lots of juice, easy settings, very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need.  I haven't jacked it up all the way....I don't think the cat would appreciate that.  I get a little feedback every so often, occasionally it's a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar,  but not enough to submarine this power packed amp.  How do you get that much noise out of an 8&#34; speaker?"
0,1,"The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes. I don""t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it. The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound. This cable is complete garbage. Never again!"
0,3,Cable would be O.K. If the end connections would stay screwed together. Maybe some lock tight would help. These connectors worry me.
1,5,I was a bit skeptical at first to purchase this. But its a nice cable! No noise or hum whatsoever!
1,5,"I don't do heavy gigging just home studio play but I have had no issues with quality or sound.  It looks cool and sounds just fine and clear.  I like the metal connecters, they are easy to plug in and pull out at have a nice heft.It is not a super high quality cord but it does an excellent job for the price.  I will be buying these again."
1,5,The product was exactly what was advertised and completely filled the Job it was intended for. service was more than expected
1,4,"Only reason i gave it four stars is it is advertised to lean back and mine does not. but it sounds great as ampeg always has, heavy duty built perfect for house jamming and practice amp."
0,3,"I bought this amp for practicing my bass at home.  I really liked the sound.  It was crisp and clear, just like I expected from an Ampeg.It looked great and felt solid.Then after two weeks it developed an annoying metallic rattle inside the case.  The rattle just got worse, louder as I played.  It was very annoying.  I didn't feel comfortable opening up a new amp and trying to trouble shoot it myself. I had visions of voiding the warranty and being stuck with an amp I couldn't play.I was sad returning the Ampeg, great sound for the price, but I was soured on Ampeg, perhaps unfairly from a sample of 1. I replaced it with a Fender Bronco which has an Ampeg emulation setting so my bass world is back in balance.Admittedly since the Fender Bronco was more than twice as expensive as the Ampeg, I have thought that I could have just taken the money I spent on the Fender Bronco and bought a more expensive Ampeg, on the guess that a more expensive Ampeg would have a better design or materials or quality control.  But a guess is just a guess and I didn't want to test that guess by throwing more money at Ampeg, so the Fender Bronco got my money.My rating of 3 stars is an average of 5 stars for quality of sound, and a 1 star for quality of production."
1,5,"For those looking for a solid, well made bass amp to step up to from the cheapies that usually come with beginner bass set ups, this is a hard one to beat. It has 25 watts, a line out for outputting to a PA system or bass cabinet, and an effects loop for adding effects pedals. The design is solid, well made and will go the distance. This is my second one, the first one went two years with zero problems, and I beat it up nearly every day gigging at small venues and just plain abusing it....it took it well. Highly recommended!"
1,5,"beyond stoked! bought so i could teach my son bass...i cant believe how much sound comes out of this box. ampeg will always build my bass rigs, however big or small"
1,5,"It might just be my pickups or my strings, but if you set the bass above seven or so, the bass gets fairly fizzy on the E string. The effects loop is useless, and it removes a lot of the character from the pedals, but that's good news because with this amp you don't need an effects loop because there is no built in overdrive. So if you ever do use a driven/distorted tone, you should just put a pedal in between your bass and this amp."
1,5,"I was really looking forward to receiving this amp. I read the positive reviews and the Ampeg name carries some weight. Unfortunately, from the moment I plugged it in there was this phaser-like effect to the sound. I tried different basses with it. I tried different cables with it. I tried using it in different places, away from computers and fluorescent lights. I tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase-shifter sound came out. I tried all different knob and EQ settings as well. Nothing helped. So, I'm returning it and hoping I just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better. I used to work for an amp manufacturer so I know these things happen and I don't think less of Ampeg, (at least not yet).I really hope it's a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful. For $99 it's packed with cool features like an effects send, a CD in, a Line out for hooking up to a PA and a headphone out for quiet practice. It also just looks cool and very pro. My intention is to use this for a monthly ""bistro"" gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small, so this seems absolutely perfect if I get one that performs like all the other reviews I see here.I have to say, buying from Amazon is the ONLY way to buy these things online. They immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as I filled out the return UPS label. If there is a choice between Amazon.com and other vendors, and even if Amazon is a couple bucks more, I recommend using Amazon. The customer service is so easy and immediate it's worth the piece of mind.I'll update this review when I get the new amp later this week.I upgraded my review based on the replacement I received...see below..."
0,1,"I purchased this amp locally and initially, I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all, but when I played around with some of the ""standard"" models (just the amp model, no effects) just to see how it's clean sound was, the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max. The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on... I've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it, even when there was no guitar plugged in... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes; very distracting and it drove me nuts! This isn't a ground loop issue (my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond), it's clearly a defect with this product. Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse, again, even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume. You'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil, but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS. WTF?The next issue is the weird ""fizz"" sound, that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string, instead of a clean note, there's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that ""surrounds"" the note, and fades as the string stops moving. It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency. Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is, neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in, or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in... but I'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans. I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12"" Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. Apparently, the Mustang I and II don't have these issues, and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp. Is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? There is speculation that the LCD screen (which is not present on the I or II) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and Fender doesn't seem to care...Definitely try this before you buy it. You may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. I am disappointed that Fender hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong, but I'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is ""something"" wrong.Whatever... I took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead. Guess what? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz, even when cranked. How about that? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.I'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that I'd like to try. But before I buy another Fender amp, I'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds."
1,4,"***Update*** After heavy play for 6 months, this is my favorite amp by a mile. I also have a ZT Lunchbox that I use for church work (miles of clean headroom and designed specifically for pedals). The Mustang III would work just fine, but I can throw the ZT in a backpack with my pedals (I only use an OD, chorus and reverb for church) and it has a lot more volume of I do youth group stuff outside and can't mic up.I have several friends that play music as a primary source of income and 3 of them purchased the Mustang for it's overall lightweight, terrific sound and low price. Played on the clean channels (settings 88-99) with pedals will give you an amazing tone that lets you forget it's not a tube amp - and for the most part, the crowd is clueless to begin with. I did purchase the VOX AC4 and it was so one dimensional and limited it went right back. Terrific for gigs or practice, a back up or just beginning guitar.So this is the 3rd amp I've purchased in a very short amount of time. I traded in my Line 6 and also purchased a Roland Micro Cube. Chalk it up to a new guitar player and a whole world of amplifiers from every price range and style. I bought the Line 6 becuase it had a lot of features and presets that I thought would be really fun. They are, but Line 6 is for metal, despite ""You can play anything on it"" marketing. Turns out I really enjoy playing country and blues (although I listen to punk, classic rock and metal (pre-1995).Enter the Mustang III. It also is feature loaded, but with one kicker. The models of the vintage Fender amps. I have a very close friend that plays a 65' Twin Reverb - he was shocked at the modeling. The Bassman is another that is just off the charts good. The LCD screen is bigger and overall very simple to use. The Vox model is also really jangly sounding - like it's supposed to. I have to add that with Vox in particular, you can get the crunch without having to use massive volume. This is true of modeling amps across the board and a huge advantage over tubes in general. For $300 you can get a Vox w/ an overdrive, delay and reverb. And you can get the full effect with the volume dialed to 3, not 11. It doesn't sound exactly like a Vox - but I don't gig. I'm a basement rockstar - the Mustang gets it done without any problems.Adding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive. That's without the FUSE software. I'm not big into recording, so I'm content using it from the  LCD, but the Fuse software is slick. The virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp. The screen is easy to navigate and you can see exactly what effects you're using where they are set at.The only reason I've given it 4 stars is beacuse is lacks low end punch and more importantly doesn't quite have the warmth of a tube amp. To be clear - tube amps sound like tube amps. If you are a metal guy on a solid state budget, Line 6 is still the way to go. If you're more into the old school r'n'r sounds, take a look at the Mustang III. Excellent sounds and value."
0,3,"I was really interested in the M3 and checked with the Fender forum and I found that there is a problem with the M3.  You can go to the Fender forum and read about it under the Mustang amp section.To make the long story short, some(not all) M3, M4, M5's have what is decribed as a ""fizz"" on the clean setting when hitting the low e string.  Sometimes it's noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible.  Some people think it's the power supply but nobody knows for sure.  Apparently, Fender has not made a statement to its cause although they admitted that there is a 'fizz' problem.  There is also a sample sound clip there on this 'fizz'.Like I said, I just want people to know about this before buying a M3. Now, I am considering the M2 which also has the 'fizz' problem but with the the software fix released from Fender, there is no 'fizz' in the M2. I don't know if it is fair for me to give it a rating because I didn't get the M3, but if I bought it, I would give it a rating of 3 stars because I don't like this 'fizz' on the clean setting and it would be unusable for me.  If it didn't have this 'fizz' I would give it a 5 star rating."
1,5,"I can't say enough good about this amp. I have a Marshall jcm 800 2203 which is a great tube amp, but side by side this little amp really stacks up. First and foremost if you want a tube amp sound go buy a tube amp. But if you want something that is 90% close, well this is it. So versatile, light weight, and well constructed. Great Fender quality for a great price. Love all the presets. I have no problem with buzzing on any channel, clean or otherwise. Excellent guitar amp and I would highly recommend!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!"
1,5,"I gave it five stars! I purchased this for my young son but I find myself drawn to it because of all the really great things this amp does.  I wanted something flexible and decided to buy the Mustang III over the II because of the power and the larger speaker.I've read the reviews here and they pretty much sum up what I think about the amp. It sounds great and it has loads of power.  Since it's solid-state, it falls apart a bit when pushed really hard and lacks a little at the bottom end, but for this price?!? Wow! I have no complaints.One thing most have failed to mention is the non-amp features like the input for an MP3 player and the Fuse software that comes with the amp for customizing tones, creating jam tracks and setting up the amp to suit his tastes. Both Mac and Windows are supported. My son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively. Since he's 11, he doesn't have many opportunities to play with others. He can create jam/click tracks and play along. We also downloaded new firmware from Fender and used the software to eliminate a fizz issue that existed in earlier versions.People who own this amp can create their own tones and tracks, then upload them to Fender's user web site. We watched a David Gilmour concert and he was inspired. He wanted a tone that sounded like his. We downloaded a few Pink Floyd tones created by other people.  One of them was particularly great. We tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it.  He loves it.Great amp. I can't compare to Line 6 but I can compare it to other amps I've heard. It's pretty nice.  Equally nice is the fact he can experiment with tones without spending a pile of $$$ on FX."
1,5,"ConstructionThis Amp certainly looks sharp. It is not nearly as heavy as I would expect a 100W amp to be, but seems well put together.ControlsThe III comes with a 2 button Foot Pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly. (You can expand to add an optional 4 button switch that Fender sells separately and also includes in the IV and V.)On the amp, you have separate EQ knobs (Treble, Mids and Low) you have a gain, a volume, a Master Volume and a Reverb. Along with these, you also have an LCD screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals, presets, delays and reverbs. You also have separate buttons for changing Amp models, reverb, delays and modulation effects. The large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets, and once you press it, you can go into deep editing of the amp models, effects and presets.The controls are intuitive and easy to use. It is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs.Comparing to other amps:The Fender GDEC 3 does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself. You need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly. But on the Mustang III, you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer.I don't know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful.The Sound (Most important)Let me first compare this amp to what Line 6, Vox, and Peavy have offered in the past. All of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects... BUT... How many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them? Line 6 offers tons of sounds... most of them are what I would call ""niche"" sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro, or some crazy effects laden sound. What I find with Line 6 is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed. They don't sound overdriven, they just sound distorted. Also, Line 6 offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock, metal, and maybe even some weird jazz fusion. These sounds are unique and interesting, but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that I love and looking for useful rock, blues, and metal tones.What I can say about the Mustang III is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed. The Vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds. These are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the Real Thing. You can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 88-99. By playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps. A few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are:'57 Champ This amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little 8 inch Champ. Tons of character and tone. You can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model. Think the Jimi Blues cd. The presets that use this amp that Fender created are all really fun and sound amazing.Fender Bassman Wow! You can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model. It has the recognizable tone of the Bassman modeled really well. Big Bold bottom end with some singing highs.'65 Deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model. Throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock/blues. Or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone.The British Amps are all good models of Vox and Marshall type amps. They are all bold and in your face. Just play one ACDC riff into the 70's amp and you'll recognize the sound.As far as the Vintage tones go...I dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere. If you play rock, blues, Country, hard rock or Jazz, you have so many great choices. People who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs.What surprises me is that Fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music. I was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good.I was wrong. The 90's stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it. I'm pretty sure that this is a Mesa Boogie type of model. This is certainly your Metallica amp.The 2000 metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too.The BIG bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the SuperSonic. This amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal, thrash or whatever. If you overdrive it with a built in pedal, you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this. I play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that I like. I personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this SuperSonic amp.The fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones. You can have one guy who sets all 100 presets with vintage tones, and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash. It is limitless.I would, without a doubt choose this amp over ANY modeling amp out there for practice and fun.I own a pimped out MIM Strat, and a off-the-rack Classic Vibe Strat and Tele as well as a Les Paul style guitar. They ALL sound very cool on this amp. The Classic Vibe 60's Strat really impresses me through this amp. So versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound. I am really loving it!This amp can play really really loud with it's 100 Watts, but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes. (I have 4 kids and practice at night, and this amp is perfect.)Fender Fuse and Ableton SoftwareI have to admit that I really don't feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what I can do manually on the amp. However, You'll find amazing tones all over the Fender Fuse. The system is super easy to use and store on your amp. As with any open online forum, you will have to wade through tones that you don't love and aren't described well. But you will find some gems too.I have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet, so I will have to save that review for later.The FINAL WORDI am a Father of 4 who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes. I like Vintage tones as much as Heavy stuff, so I like a variety of tones. I hate overprocessed guitar tones. This amp is perfect for me. Perfect. The amp models are great, and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds. It comes with a built in tuner, tap tempo effects, a two button footswitch, an effects loop, a digital interface, deep editing computer software, a headphone jack, a usb port, recording software, and moreAt $299 This amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased. I have a $300 strat that I love that sounds beautiful through it. After buying it, I have listed a Tube amp and several effects pedals that I have loved because I no longer will play it.There is no better modeling amp for my needs!"
0,3,A cheap guitar at best..no bite to it at all..does not get me excited..learned religoulsy on an acoustic so was excited when i got this cheap from gc for less then 100..low e doesnt stay in tune well pickups suck hard to play being its a jr and just awkward (which is my fault) do love the color and look of it..but thats not what guitars are for right..itll serve its purpose until i can afford a Real American Strat..not great at all..but passable Id return it if i could.
1,5,"I ordered this Epi Jr because I had one years ago my Son adopted for his own and missed having one. Saw this in TV yellow and had to have it. I came well packed and looked much better in person than the pics on the website. It was set-up very well, among the few guitars I have purchased that were playable out of the box. Fret work is top notch. Finish is good, some very slight blems but if you play it like you should you'll add some of your own. There was a slight binding in the nut, most people think it's the tuners right away but most tuning problems are at the nut. A quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up. If you can't make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech. When you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue. The only thing I did was lower the bridge a bit and this thing plays like a dream. Plugged in it sounds good, you can get a lot of different sounds with the simple use of the volume and tone. Picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound. Play close to the bridge with tone wide open puts you in Tele territory while using the volume to clean things up or add some dirt to the sound. Add some tone knob and pick closer to the neck to get into the blues region. This guitar will make you a more versatile player. The absence of a neck pickup reduces the magnetic pull on the strings and lets them ring out. Sustain is very good as a result. I could carry on forever but you get the idea. I've been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that. I own many vintage guitars including Gibson, Fender, Gretsch. I have the most pleasure from playing the newer imports, the quality is superb on the most recent ones. Tone snobs may laugh but my new Epi Les Paul Jr plays just as well as most anything out there."
1,5,"i got it ,i played for a very while and i just got shocked with a great sound, great finished guitar and for the price definitely was a Great Deal!!! i play rock n roll, i'm 34,been on the road for a while playin' and i can recommended for sure!!!"
1,4,"Pretty decent sound, and it's not too small for an adult to play, but having no pickup on the left hand side severely limits the warm, jazzy tones you can get. Still very satisfied."
1,5,"I just thought I would throw in another 5 star review which is based on the cost vs quality factor. I have several guitars, and always thought Epiphone to be an inferior guitar. Well I was dead wrong. It may not have the price tag of my ""better"" guitars, but it sure has the playability and sound. Especially for the $100 tag on it. Great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection. The simple, yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat. I will not shy away from Epiphone anymore. Don't make the mistake of not picking up this guitar only because it's not stamped Gibson."
1,5,"The instructions could be written much better but I really like having one of these, in fact, I'll probably get a second one to tie to the first one so I can include more instruments.I guarantee, if you get one of these, you'll have a hard time leaving it alone. You can even work it into your live performances."
1,5,"You may have experienced the problems of musicians. The drummer is drunk and the rhythm guitar is late. But you need to rehearse. This gets the job done, you can lay down rhythm lines and drum lines and get the sound you want. The thing to remember is that whatever effect you are using for the lead, will kick in on any recording playback as they use the same input jack. Otherwise, easy and a great product. The best is, that if you are playing really poor lead work, nobody can hear but you! lol."
1,5,"I play bass,...and have for 40 years.  One thing I've come to like a lot about playing music on my instrument is the development of various kinds of sound effects, effects pedals, etc.  Laying down a 'track' or musical run of notes, then building another one over the top of that, and then another, and another once was only able to be done in a studio.  Now, with my Boss RC-3, I can do it any time I want.  In rehearsal it is absolutely wonderful... I can get a couple of rhythm lines going, then have the ability to begin developing a bass lead line to suit,...or play along to develop my 'chops',...whatever is warranted.  This pedal, like other Boss pedals I've purchased, is made to last longer than you (kind of kidding), the electronics have been engineered with nothing but precision and control, and the pedal will do all the manual says it will.  Best bet, watch a few YouTube videos showing its use by a number of musicians.  That helps you understand a lot,...then like me you can buy one and it will bring you playing pleasure for certain."
1,5,"The Boss RC-3 Loop Pedal is great for playing guitar in a band, or with friends, but also a big help practicing. It comes with 10 pre-set rhythm tracks but the real fun is laying down your own chord sequences with your guitar and then being able to play lead guitar over that rhythm loop with just a quick stomp on the pedal. It makes practicing etc. a lot of fun and meaningful. I haven't figured out all the possibilities yet - and probably never will - but it is a cool pedal to have. Like all Boss pedals, it's as sturdy as a little truck."
1,5,"I've read some complaints about this unit.  Maybe those folksshould shell out an additional $300 for something better.To the rest of you, with the 99 storage units, this is a great tool.My band, I to be exact, uses this to store backing tracks for songswe play.  For instance, one of our songs has a difficult drum track.I just loaded the whole pre-recorded track into a slot.Or, one of our songs has a train whistle in the background.  I loadedthe effect into a slot.Or, another song we do needs birds tweeting and children laughingand playing in the background.  I recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot.Basically any instrument or sound effect accompaniment you need, butdon't have someone else to play it, you can play it back using this device."
1,4,Another great Roland product.  Really easy to use and well built .... very good sound.  great for practice.  Certainly do not get the RC 2  ... get this RC 3 model for the memory banks and ability to store the banks later...I did think of getting the larger ones but those are just way to big... Check for sales or demos
1,4,"This pedal work, although I find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup. My issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough. The M195 does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal, even running the delay on the output side of the M195. The noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup. I run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig, when using fuzz and distortion."
1,4,"It does what is supposed to, i'ts a gate, and clamps the noise as good as I expected, at the begining I had problems with power, some how it didn't power correctly, but I was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain, so I solved it isolating the MXR connecting it with another power supply, and it work, so I left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine, also check config and the routing of the signal, this might influence on how it works, I have it right after my Wha and before my compressor, and it works just fine."
1,4,"I use this every now and then, it does seem to suck tone, but it does reduce noise, though I actually stopped using it and didn't hear much difference! with distortion and reverb, things can get a little noisy in there, but the original tone with everything set up is worth it unaltered. but I will keep this as it will come in handy one day I'm sure."
1,5,"I couldn't be happier with this pedal. I have a Les Paul/Marshall Class 5/BB preamp/EP Booster/Analog Chorus and Carbon Copy... I used to get this annoying hum and feedback when I cranked the amp up, even when I just plugged the guitar straight to the amp, but those days are long gone, now everything is nice and quiet. I even have the trigger knob all the way down and it still does its job, I haven't noticed any difference in tone so far. I was scared that the Smart Gate was a better option but this one has worked like a charm and it's cheaper, not to mention it has its own effects loop. I don't understand how the Noise Supressor or the Decimator could be better than this one, I mean, the pedal will get rid of the noise yes or no."
1,5,"I don't really care for the FX loop on my Fender Supersonic Head, as I started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the MXR pedals. so when this came out last year I snatched one up and started experimenting with it. I LOVE it, bypassed I still get that in your face strait into an amp sound, but ingage it with my delays and phase 90's and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss. very cool, and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank"
1,4,"I received this as a gift for a smaller pedalboard I was assembling - my plan was to try something different to compare against the Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor on my other board.  While I love the build quality and simplicity of the one-knob setup, I can't say (yet) that I like it better than my NS-2.  With the caveat that I may not have it wired up 100% correctly, I felt that it did kill most of the excess noise, but not all of it.  Good product, but maybe not the best of all the options at the same price.  Will update this post after I play around with different arrangements and get more experience with it."
1,5,"First off, I'd like to address any construction concerns.  The nanoKontrol2 is actually sturdier than I imagined it would be, despite some of the reviews here.  The case is rigid plastic, as are the rotary knobs and faders, and everything seems pretty solid (I like the travel feel in the faders - not a lot of resistance, but not flimsy-feeling either). The buttons are soft, dense rubber, like a pad controller, and light up when they are pressed. If you have big hands, then you might have issues with using this as a live performance controller since everything is in such a compact space.The supplied mini USB cable fits nice and snug.Bottom line, if you take reasonable care with this unit, it seems like it should give you a lot of dependable service.I tried this right out of the box with Reason 7 - there is no built-in Reason template for it, but it was recognized by Reason when I did a controller surface scan, and it was a piece of cake to map the top knobs to pan controls and the faders to volume faders and the solo and mute buttons to their counterparts on the Reason mixer. Basically, I just bought this to do crossfades, and the nanoKontrol2 will be perfect for that, but I can also see using this to automate some softsynth parameters just as easily.Next, I set this up to control Peff's Directre Rack Extension, and it's a blast!The transport buttons did correctly automap to Reason's transport controls, so you can record, play, stop, fast forward and reverse from the nanoKontrol2.I didn't download the nanoKontrol2 editor yet, but that should increase the utility of this device.If the ""S"", ""M"" and ""R"" buttons lit up in different colors (all lights are red), it would make this unit more useful as a performance controller in my opinion, but as it stands, this budget mixer/performance control surface is well worth $50!"
1,5,"Item shipped earlier than I've expected. When I opened the box was surprised as I didn't notice the usb cable. But later I thought that it was impossible and opened the box from another side and here it was...I have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds. It is working fine. Though it has no motorized faders, it doesn't make my work uncomfortable at all. I have connected it to a Reaper and Protools software and it's just working perfect!I recommend it to home studios, also those who travel with recording gear. Nano is small but quite durable.I am happy with it!"
1,5,After a little bit of configuration headaches I can confirm this product works quite well with ardour2 and is my prefered method of mixing. For the price it's a really good deal.
1,5,"Great little controller for your DAW, or whatever.Easy to set up.  Dials and sliders work smoothly.I use it with Reaper.The 8 sliders and associated dials and buttons are logicallyshiftable, so this little darling can handle any number of tracks,not just 8.Buy it!!"
1,4,"Windows 7 install worked fine.I use Mixcraft Pro 6 and it's working well.I did have an issue with the drivers, since I had too many midi devices, but the fix wasn't too hard."
1,5,"Great product for the price!I am using it with Win7 64bit & Sonar XL Producer.I just held down the ""set-marker"" & ""record"" button while plugging the usb cable.I then let Windows 7 Plug & Play the Drivers (No Disk Needed).Next I set Sonar XL Midi Control Surface device as MACKIE & selected the nanoKontrol2 as the Control -Midi in and out.Now I have 8 channels of automation & stop, back, record, play etc.I am very happy with this product so far.I have to give it 5 stars on the price to performance ratio.READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!I do not recomend downloading the KORG software if used for SONAR XL.Buttons and sliders and great for the price.Cheers"
1,5,"I was hell bent of getting an analog delay and the local shop didn't have the one that I was looking for (MXR Carbon Copy), so they recommended that I try out the TC Flashback Digital Delay instead. This is priced comparably to the Carbon Copy, but it has so many more features (I guess that's expected of a digital delay) that I couldn't pass it up.Similar to the other TC product that I purchased (Corona Chorus), this sounds great, it's feature rich, and easy to use.The analog and tape delay modes do a very nice job of emulating the sound I wanted to get from the analog Carbon Copy, but it also has tons of other settings to pull out a digital sound; think exact repeats and a delay of up to 6 seconds. Shorter delays can be had by switching to the slap back mode, which puts this pedal into instant Rock-A-Billy mode.This is tone print enabled, (a feature that I have yet to try, but it seems like a cool concept), has a tap tempo setting and a 40 second looper all in one small delay box.This is the first delay that I've owned and I'm not looking back."
0,2,"TC is very overrated.Many pedals I have out performs this in my opinion.  The vintage BBDs (MXR Vintage DElay, Morley 70's echo) for example just take it.  But for newer pedals I liked the MXR Carbon Copy and Ibanex DE 7 much better."
1,5,"If you love delay and want variety, this is your pedal.  I run two amps when I play (often) and the ping pong is delightful for me.  However, in the studio, this pedal shines as well providing a variety of incredible delay options.  Being Toneprint enabled is a 100% plus.  Very clean, quiet, and durable.  Excellence!"
1,5,This is by far the best delay effects box I've ever used and it has so much potential that it'll take you hours to get through ever possible sound this baby offers.  It's also true bypass which is very useful for gigging musicians who want to keep their rack as noiseless as possible and their signal as strong as possible from beginning to end.  It is built like a tank and doesn't take up much space on your pedal board making this overall a very user-friendly pedal.  Wish all pedals were built this way.  Highly recommended!
1,5,"It's an excellent pedal well designed, perfect size,incredible quality, if you are looking for a U2 delay's stile it is perfect for you..."
1,5,"This pedal is a great delay pedal. works well with my marshall,Has a lot of feautures and is very versitale...."
1,5,"I have been through a few delay pedals trying to get the sound I want.1) Boss digital delay: I really didn't like the sound of the delay overall. No real positives to mention2) Carbon copy analog delay : Worked great for cleans. But totally muddied up my lead distortion tone (even though it was in my fx loop). I couldn't get the repeats to duck under the main signal3) Nova Delay : I really wanted to like this. Presets, tap tempo and a nice feature set. But the sound just lacked warmth. It was very digital soundingAt this point I wasn't sure what I wanted. Analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy. Digital delays were clear sounding but.. just too digital and uninspiring!I was debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline, when I found this pedal. Analog dry signal thru with digital delay !! This is what the magic sauce is in my opinion. Now my signal has the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved. Set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect. Sure, it doesn't have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay, this can't be beat at this price range.Sure enough, when I checked the strymon timeline specs, I found out that it too has the analog dry through with digital delay. Just that its delays may be modeled better and it has a rich feature set. But $450+ for a delay pedal is just too much for me.Buy this if you are chasing tone, you won't be disappointed. Skip if looking for presets, tap tempo etc."
1,4,"Smart design, excellent performance.  What more could you want?  The Samson Meteor Mic USB Studio Microphone is a cardioid mic that is easy to set up and use, with great pick up for desktop podcasts, user testing, screencasting and similar.Being a relatively new user to anything but a basic desk mic, I had to look up what 'cardioid' meant.  I found a solid explanation at a site called WiseGeek.  They explain 'cardioid':  ""Several different microphones have been designed throughout the years to accomplish very different tasks. Some -- such as condenser microphones -- pick up a great deal of sound from several directions, while others pick up one focused sound only from one direction. Of this latter group, the cardioid microphone is perhaps the most popular, as it picks up almost exclusively the desired sound while ambient noise is hardly noticeable. It gets its name because of its pattern of sensitivity, which is roughly shaped like a heart when drawn out on an axis. This means that most of the sound it picks up comes from the front of the microphone, while minimal noise is picked up from the rear and only marginal noise is picked up from the sides.""  (My apologies to those pros out there who didn't need this clarification.)Having used the Samson Go Mic USB Compact Mic for a few months, I was familiar with the Samson brand prior to receiving this mic through the Amazon Vine program.  I had actually wanted to purchase it instead of the Go Mic, but the price difference of about thirty was a bit too much for me at the time.I've been happy with theSamson Go Mic Compact USB Microphone - Plug n' Playfor use with my desktop and laptop PCs.  I do a lot of usability testing for various websites, and it's imperative that clients are able to clearly hear my explanations via voice without background noise, pops, hisses or similar.  I have to say that the Samson Meteor is a touch better, offering clear, crisp recording and reproduction.  It also seems to pick up virtually no background noise, which is fabulous!I like the retro styling of the Meteor, and the built-in stand is great for desktops.  Less portable than the Samson Go Mic, the stand does fold neatly onto the mic for easy transport in the included soft pouch.  The included USB cable is also of ample length for easy set-up in a multitude of situations.The mute button on the front of the Meteor is very handy.  Much easier than using software to get the job done, and an amber light makes it easy to recognize it's muted.The build quality of the mic is excellent! Very solid, high-end feel.  You can use the integrated headset port to monitor your voice and adjust levels with a dial that rotates around the mute button on the front.The Samson Meteor didn't ship with any software, which while unnecessary for installation (my Windows 7 and 8 PCs automatically installed it when hooked up via the included USB), but would have been nice to have some music mixing or other similar software bundled with it.Another product I'm reviewing the:Samson C01UCW Studio USB Mic with Cakewalk Sonar LEand the Samson Go Mic both ship with Cakewalk software. The Samson Go Mic with Cakewalk Music Creator LE, and the C01UCW ships with Cakewalk's SONAR LE software, so I found it kind of surprising the Meteor did not at this price point.  For me it works out, as the others have the software and they work with the Meteor.The included booklet includes a Quick Start guide for PC and Mac, Installation how-to, the Layout (diagrams), Specifications, Polar Patten & Frequency response, and Recording Techniques for vocals, acoustic guitar, piano, guitar amp, and overhead drum kit.  The Samson Meteor Mic Warranty Card is also in the booklet.Overall, I'm very pleased with this microphone and will be using it instead of the Go Mic on my desktop for daily work which will include using Dragon voice recognition software.  I have purchased an adapter to use it with my iPad so I can play with Garage Band, and know it will be great for future screencasts.My only disappointment is in the lack of an included software package, which other Samson products (as mentioned) have packaged with them. I give this product 4 out of 5 stars (""I Like It"") for this reason.  If Samson included software - it'd be a 5 star product for me."
1,4,"The product photos make this look like a small, plastic item with cheesy chrome plating. Nope! It's a very solid, fairly large item made of heavy cast metal. You could drive nails with this thing--no exaggeration.The folding legs are clever and provide good support for desktop use, but they have some drawbacks. Yes, the Meteor has standard mic stand threads in its base, so you can put it on a mike stand or boom. But if you want to mount this mic in a shock-absorbing rig (I'm using a scissor-arm suspension boom with shock mount), you'll find the body is too short for the shock mount's sleeve to grip, and the three legs get in the way. I had to make a special adapter from 1 5/8&#34; plastic pipe and assorted hardware.The Meteor's sound is great as far as I'm concerned, but I'm not a professional audio engineer, so I'm not going to try to tell you that this is the equal of a $1,200 Sennheiser studio microphone. It is better than Samson's inexpensive GoMic, which I also have. I certainly have no complaints. I've used it to record voice and ukulele playing, and it's done a bang-up job with both."
1,5,SUPER usb mic!  I use this when I broadcast from streetjelly.com. I set it a few feet away from my amp and this mic picks up the sound and send a super clean and clear signal. JUST make sure you have ALL your mic levels set to NOT CLIP and you will get nothing but super clear sounds from this mic.
1,4,"Perhaps more than anything else, it was the introduction and subsequent success of the Zoom H2 personal digital recorder that led to an explosion of interest among home audiophiles, who suddenly found themselves equipped to make quasi-professional-level recordings with their computers plus a minimum of user-friendly equipment at reasonable prices.  The price of the Samson Meteor USB mic, a fairly recent entry, has come down to the point of being fairly valued (initially, I was seeing it going for prices above the better-sounding Blue Yeti mic).  It's an attractive (some would say ""cute"") little mic with its quaint ""retro"" design and deceptively fold-up, portable size.  I say ""deceptive"" because, due to the non-adjustable mic stand, it can be more than a little challenging to find space for it on a desktop, next to a computer, and squarely in front of the narrator's mouth.Bearing in mind the above reservation along with the actual quality of the recorded sound (it's good, but nowhere close to studio-quality), it would seem to make the most sense for those seeking ""high fidelity"" audio to spend the extra 20% for a Blue Yeti or an Audio Technica AT2020 USB (as tempting as the lower price of the non-USB version of the AT2020 is, be sure to try it out with a pre-amp supplying phantom power before going that route.  I've known a couple of individuals who ordered the AT2020 condenser mic, only to discover that it was useless with a computer, even with the addition of a Snake Light cable).If your primary considerations are convenience and portability, the Samson Go mic sounds almost as good as the Meteor and is unmatched in size, convenience and portability.  (It scored higher than the Blue Mikey and Blue Snowflake in my auditions.)  I'm tempted to say it's the perfect laptop mic, clipping to the top cover more securely than the Snowflake, whereas the Yeti is ideal for desktop use, producing rich-sounding recordings rivaling those of a professional studio's Shure SM7B mics."
0,3,"I like everything about this mike, except one: No gain adjustment on the mike. You have to do it from the software. That was a big disappointment, because I had imagined that the knob on the mike was a gain adjustment.Of course, if you are just recording talk for podcasts, you probably won't care. But if you are recording instruments (particularly loud instruments), you might really want to have gain control as software gain adjustment is not convenient and is actually absent from quite a few recording apps."
0,3,"Just got this today and I'm experiencing serious install issues. Please note that I'm not a newbie to this stuff. I'm an IT guy. I have a new Acer computer that's less than 3 months old with a new install of Windows 7. The mic is recognized, but not as a sound input device, just as an ""Other USB Device"". I tried installing it on another laptop and it installed quickly and easily, so it's not that the mic itself doesn't work.My purpose in posting this is to let people considering this mic know that you can't just assume that the install is a no-brain'r (at least not on a PC). The Samson tech support was friendly enough, but not very helpful. They had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support. The support guy said, ""well, that's really all there is to it"", which I can understand...but I still have a $70 mic that won't work with my computer. I tried contacting Microsoft tech support and they tried to help me too, but we could never get the mic to be seen as an input device. We tried it a number of ways and nothing worked.I ordered this for use with my iPad as well, and I ordered the ""camera kit"" to do so. Despite what I'd seen in the reviews and videos online, the mic I received would work not with that either. The Mic needs to be powered by the iPad and it seemed mine was not getting enough power from the iPad because the little indicator light was still Amber when plugged in (indicating it's not getting enough power) instead of Blue.I tried this on my wife's iPad and my daughter's too so it would not appear to be the iPad that is the problem (though it could be the camera connector, I suppose.)So...I ended up returning the whole shooting match. Disappointing too...I really like the design of the mic and so many people say that it sounds so good."
1,5,"This bag includes several different thicknesses of picks so you can see which fits your playing style best, and the varied colors means the more vain of us can color coordinate our pick and instrument."
1,5,It was nice to have many types as I had no idea the thickness I would like. It also helped my boyfriend decide also.
1,5,It's a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like. I also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me.
1,5,"Exactly what it says it is, comes fast in an envelope. Hard to mess up a pack of plastic triangles though. Design looks great in the light too."
1,4,I bought a bag of these various picks just to throw around our practice studio. Most of the band members don't mind them. Its great to have picks lying all over the place so you can grab one during takes. Recommended.
1,5,I got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me.  The balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet.  Construction features too well soldered TRS 1/4&#34; male connections and the only downside I can complain about is the lack of strain relief...but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less.
1,5,"A little disappointed with the cable.  Pretty light weight.  Don't know why it didn't work, just shorted out.  Luckily one of the band members had another one.  Wouldn't trust it again, so I returned them."
1,4,"Good cable and has m et all of our needs.  As all of know who use cables, only time will tell whether they will last."
1,5,"I was looking for a 25' TRS cable for my band room, I wanted a quality cable with reasonalbe durability although I was willing to compromise some durability for cost and I feel this was an excellent choice. Yes, there are better cables available at a much higher price but I feel this is a well built cable and great value."
1,5,"It's fairly tough, but flexible.  No noise that I can hear, and the connectors look solidly-mounted.  I would definitely buy this brand again."
1,5,I keep one with my guitar and one at home and never had a fall. Its small enough to keep in my guitar case and cheap enough to replace if it gets lost. What more could you want?
1,5,I wanted something to keep my guitars from falling after I change guitars. I bought this because it looked pretty good and it was cheap. It has served it's purpose and I use it nearly everyday. Very happy with purchase!
0,3,"Just skimming through the other reviews, I see that at least one other reviewer has complained about the same thing. Nearly every time you pick up your guitar, the rest will fall off your desk. The part that sits on the desk should've been weighted to prevent this from happening. It's a nice idea and does what it says - it keeps your guitar nice and safe from scuffs when leaned up against your desk.But considering this one REALLY annoying flaw, I wonder if I shouldn't have just payed a couple more bucks for another guitar stand instead of this rest."
0,3,"If your going to use on amp get some two sided Velcro and stick on amp, or two sided tape etc.  For price its fine.  Amazon is the best."
0,2,"it is ok as long as you don't bump your guitar, else boom, it hits the floor.  I don't trust it and amazon has it way over priced.  It will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place."
1,5,One thing tho.  When your guitar isn't in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere.  I am going to be finding picks in my files for years.  Put it up on the table when your picks are not in it.
0,3,"Another excellent gadget from Planet Waves. What a great idea. Already has made my life easier. Keep a pile of Jazz IIIs in the concave pocket (shallow depression for holding stuff). I don't own any very expensive guitars, so I'm not concerned about resting their bodies on my carpet. The guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible, and that means... you're more apt to grab your axe and play more.When un-weighted by the guitar neck, the Rest itself is rather light and can move around easily. No big deal at all.*****************************EDIT: Just purchased another one -- an axe close at hand is an axe you will play. That's been my experience. After living with this for a few days one thing has become an annoyance: when there's no guitar holding it to the table, it's very easy to knock it off the desk. The way it is designed is such that the leverage has a see-saw effect that will have it fly a few feet across the room. Because it sticks out horizontally, just a nudge with a knee and there it goes. So if you have picks or anything sitting in the round holder area, it can be an annoyance.I do use these for my guitars, but I feel much more comfortable using a proper stand. The product is worthwhile for a quick location for setting down your axe without searching for a stand.If the product had a way of either using suction or tab to secure itself to a surface it would earn another star."
1,5,"The Planet Waves Guitar Rest works for ukuleles!  I just got one, and have used it for a few days, and it's the bomb!  I can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over.  This product is a rubber disc with small ""arms"" in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface, and you can set your instrument against it, and voila, it doesn't fall over!  Here at home, I use it on the second shelf of a bookcase, and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove, heel on carpet, neck in Guitar Rest.I'm going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases, because I can use them at one of my uke parties.  If one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor, for instance, to take a whizz, they're just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them.  Here, I just find a spot near wherever I'm sitting, and it becomes my ""lean"" spot, and I can even set my beer can on the round part on the back!  Coaster uke/guitar holder.  It's quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument.  I could carry a metal stand with me, but it wouldn't fit in my ukulele case--this Planet Waves product does.  A winner."
1,4,"This is a pretty cool product. I have mine next to my computer, because I am constantly waiting on video to render, and I am constantly picking up my guitar and putting it back down; this is nice to have instead of reaching all the way to the guitar stand. It is also good to have when I am using Garage Band, and need to set the guitar down for a second. If you have a plastic chair sheet on the floor or slick vinyl flooring it won't work, the guitar wobbles and falls out; but it works great on carpet. The pick bucket is a nice touch, keeps picks from scattering all over my desk. The rubber is very grippy to my wood desk, and never moves. I would recommend this."
0,3,"Maybe they included some sticky pads and I missed it? This thing is great in theory, but it gets knocked off my desk periodically when it doesn't have a guitar resting in it.It does well at its job when it's in use, i.e. it doesn't fall when there's a guitar, but I think I'll use some tape or sticky gunk to help hold in place while it's lying in wait. ;)"
1,4,I bought this for my husband so he can use it around the home ( he has guitars everywhere). I am not sure he would trust it at a gig and he still uses his guitar stand for that purpose - only because it makes sense to use the most robust guitar stand you can when supporting guitars worth hundreds of dollars.  It is pretty good at staying in place though
1,5,"Genius idea that I wish I thought of first. I actually super glued mine to my work desk to make it permanent, but it has plenty of grip all by itself to securely hold your guitar in place. I would definitely recommend!"
1,4,It is a little light if you bump it anything that you store in the top goes everywhere when the rest falls on the floor.  As long as the guitar is on it works great.
0,3,"I've had this thing for several weeks, and just now, when it fell off the table for the 100th time, I tossed it in the trash.  The whole thing is one piece of soft floppy rubber, it's not stiff enough for the part that cradles the guitar neck, and it's not heavy enough to stay put.  Even the force from the guitar neck makes it topple over.  Unless you glue this thing to the table, or something like that, it's useless, even worse than useless, it's in the way.Addendum:  I raised the rating a bit, after hearing from the distributor/manufacturer ... at least these guys listen."
0,3,I never use it so I really only wasted my money. I have rather high end guitars so placing any of them other than very securely is not a good way to go..
1,4,"As the title, it works the way it's supposed to.  But I wish the rubber part that sits on the table is thicker and heavier so it won't move easily.  Nevertheless, it's a low cost way to set your guitar against the desk without scratching the back of the neck and preventing the guitar from sliding down from the desk and falling on the ground.  Just remember, use some common sense, don't expect the guitar to totally stable."
1,4,Good product! But I'd expected more robust on your structure. But it's good product! Don't have adhesive to bind on the surface.
0,3,"This can work, but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money. It will work if you use your guitar next to the a table."
1,5,This was a Christmas gift from my husband.  It is such cool and easy rest for the guitar.  I took it with me to our bi weekly jam and the other musicians were considering buying some for themselves.
1,4,I think this guitar rest is pretty nice. It doesn't attach on the table very good though so  don't rely on this thing too much.
1,5,"This simple rubber device works great on flat edged tables.  Table tops with a routed curved edge reduce how rubber is in contact with the table, which will effect how well it stays put.  Other then that I like it and purcheased a second one.  It is very inexpensive compared to guitar repairs.  There is also one available that looks like a guitar."
0,1,"A great idea, but pure crap in terms of functionality.  if you don't have something heavy on the flat end, the rubber piece moves, and before you know it, your axe is on the ground.  I saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight, but I'm not so hot with that idea, especially if the can is open.  The lip need to extend down longer, and *something* needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around.  If I had a permanent place to mount this, I'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and I'll get an extra guitar stand instead.  Good idea, but it doesn't work."
1,4,"There's just no way I'm going to give five stars to a piece of rubber. That's what this is. It doesn't even look quite as good as the picture, largely because the guitar picks laying on the top help a lot to dress it up. Without those picks, it's just black molded flab.The damnable thing is that this flab is actually quite useful. I bought this on a whim and cringed when I opened up the box. But for the last two weeks, it's been propping my Takemine up against a coffee table. The rubber is thick enough and non-skid enough that it keeps the guitar in place. Effortlessly. It may not be much to look at, but it works really well.The top portion that rests on a table surface is about 1/4 inch think. There's a nub in the front hat pushes up against the corner of he surface and fixes the rest in place. That's about 5/8 inch thick. The cost of materials is probably not more than 50 cents, but it's the design that sells this thing.If you can find this for less at a local shop, go for it.  I paid Amazon $6. Even at that, I consider it a good buy."
1,5,"Those of us who have leaned their guitars against the front of our amps over the years, this is a handy tool that gives a little more security for our guitars."
0,3,I just can't trust it! I thought it'd be a good idea if I needed to prop my guitar up against the amp for a minute....but I just can't get myself to do it. I always end up using a little Fender portable stand. It does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp.
1,4,"This product is worth having if, like me, you find yourself needing a place to quickly ""park"" your guitar without putting it back in the guitar stand. I use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand. Works great -- only suggestion I have it to perhaps make a version with a sticky tape underside, or a way of semi-permanently attaching it the spot where you want it so it doesn't move around. I wound up using a very small wood screw to attach it to my desk so it stays fixed. Overall -- I like it."
1,5,"This is a great value for a practice and travel instrument.(I got mine with free shipping)Built like an instrument, not a toy, it is an interesting crossover between a high strung guitar and ukelele. Fun to play, easy to take along, stays in tune well enough, and it's only a hundred bucks. I bet if you bought one you would like it."
1,4,"I bought my Yamaha guitarlele about 2 years ago from Long & McQuade located in Canada.  It's the same as the one Amazon is selling here.  I teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele.  My reason for buying this is because I don't have to learn how to play the ukulele and can play the guitarlele using the knowledge I already have - yea!It is very similar to a guitar in many important ways.  It has the same 6 strings tuned the same way.  However, and this is VERY important so please read carefully:  To get the best sound out of your new guitarlele you must tune each string up in pitch.  For example, let's take the 6th string (lowest) and tune it up to A instead of E.  Clip on your electronic guitar tuner and crank that string up a bit until the tuner reads ""A"".  It will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar.So here's the breakdown on tuning each string:6th = A5th = D4th = G3rd = C2nd = E1st = AYou really need to to tune it this way because otherwise the strings are too floppy and you won't get that beautiful ukulele voice.  The action is very good and it will not be any harder to play.The instrument overall is fairly easy to play, especially in the lower positions.  I have trouble holding it because I'm used to holding a classical guitar so I always have to make adjustments to get used to it.  Barring chords especially higher up the neck is kind of tough because the frets are so close together so I usually play easier stuff.  Also, I have discovered that certain types of music really play well and others aren't so good.  Almost all Celtic music sounds great!  Christmas carols are lovely, but Spanish stuff doesn't sound so great, imho.  The instrument just doesn't have enough power to carry some types of music.  Blues are good, and very ancient sounding tunes like those that would have been played on a 4 course guitar from back around the 15th century sound really cool on the guitarlele.  It seems to be well constructed, the tuning gears work well, the action is good, frets are inserted straight and level so I really can't find anything to complain about, especially for the price.I would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun!  It's just like a little guitar with all the same strings and same number of frets. You will probably have to tie a strap on it to hold it in place but that's not absolutely necessary, especially for those of you who are accustomed to playing small stringed instruments.I took it camping over the summer and had a great time playing it around the campfire in the evenings, something I've always wanted to do!  I'm quite fond of my guitarlele and am going to purchase another for my daughter so that we can play duets together on them!  :DUPDATE 4.10.13-------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought another guitarlele (this time from Amazon) and it is exactly like the one I purchased a few years ago.  This one is for my daughter and she is having a delightful time playing it.  We've been playing guitarlele duets together and they sound great and is such a fun thing to do!"
1,5,"The Yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful. It's like a mini classical guitar, except the recommended tuning is A-D-G-C-E-A (A-D, followed by the standard G-C-E-A tuning on a 4-string Ukulele), but it can also be turned to E-A-D-G-B-E (standard tuning on a guitar).On the standard tuning for a guitar, however, the strings sound a little floppy. A reviewer suggested using an extra hard, high tension string like theD'Addario Extra Hard Tension Classical Guitar Stringsto get around the floppiness on the E-A-D-G-B-E turning. You can use a capo with this instrument. MyKyser Capoworks on it just fine.The guitalele measures 27-1/2"" x 9"" x 2-3/4"" at their widest points. The construction quality on my copy is tiptop except for a minute area (where the neck meets the soundboard), which is lighter in color because it missed an application of wood stain (not a big deal really). The guitalele has a satin (non-glossy) finish, which is a lot less prone to the unsightly scratches a high-gloss finish might incur.The package includes a black nylon gig bag.For a high quality instrument that costs a tiny fraction of the price for a full-size guitar, the Yamaha Guitalele GL-1 is a good buy (just under a Ninety as of this writing)."
1,4,Im a man on the move and am constantly away from home. I take this bad boy with me everywhere to satify my need to pick 6 strings.  great for takin to the beach or on the boat or to entertain yourself on long car rides.
0,2,"I purchased this instrument brand new, on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that I simply could not ignore.  It was brand new, unopened, in box.  They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. In that environment I thought it a nice instrument.However, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was VERY busy and noisy.  It's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.This is indeed a 6-string ukulele.  It measures a bit over 28"" top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke.  I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range.  The advantage to this of course is it's 6 string, so if you're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering.... that is of course, until you realize that while it has 6 strings, it is not tuned like a guitar.  It's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE.  One cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned.  Being a total newbie to ukes, this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions.  So my primary purpose in purchasing this-- to have a small portable guitar, hit a snag.Now that's not totally the end of the thing, because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning.  It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup.  So all is not lost there.  It was just an unexpected surprise-- mainly because I didn't research the instrument prior to purchase (it's rare that I impulse buy).So tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument.  That's where the Yamaha really falls short.  This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand.  There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box.  That this was a ""rush job"" out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.There are no strap pegs; those will require being added by hand (not difficult, but extra expense and time).The action is of course too high.  That's not unusual-- in truth it's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise.  But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.However, the thing that bothers me the most:  if I wasn't aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele... I'd think it's was a cheap knock-off child's guitar.  There's not one thing about this instrument that says ""quality""-- which is quite disappointing.  This instrument sells for about $100.  That low cost is obvious.  This is a ""cheap guitar"" in every way.  I can't honestly say it's a toy, but it reeks ""beginner instrument"".  The tuners are as cheap as they come,  the finish is cheap, there is no decoration, no protective edging. The finish is-- unfinished.I bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon-- and I respect those reviews.  People have different tastes and for some folks this has a ""home made"" feel that they will love.  However I've been playing guitar for (mumblety mumble) deca...uh... years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap.  I own two Ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass, a hand-made violin and an Epiphone electric uke (which is of such higher quality it's not even a contest. And no I'm not hawking Epiphone.  Facts is facts, that's all.  You can read my very-positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon).When I got this  home and took a good look at it, I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship, nothing that said anything more than ""this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible"".  In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.Other than those two factors, one can find $40-$50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality.  The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice-- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke.  Other than its portability, I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price... consider it over-priced (or rather, under-made).One must grant it's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation.  But low quality is low quality.(Edit two weeks later:  I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store-- a direct competition to this instrument.  The Cordoba is MUCH nicer.  It's built better, has better sound, and is finished out much more nicely.  Sorry Yamaha, but facts is facts.  Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side, I'd have bought and kept the Cordoba.)That's my honest review.  I know some will disagree.  But others know exactly what I mean.  This isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. However-- I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom.  As mentioned, the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.Fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it.  I simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are."
1,5,"This little Guitarlele is great - I have tuned to the standard E tuning of a guitar and it manages very well. It gives a gently subdued tone, that is perfect for playing any time, even accompanying music on the TV whilst the family are watching. I have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than I had with my twelve string in the last six months.Added info:Now that the tuning has settled down, it is keeping tune very well, with no need to retune during playing.The strings it came with are not the best though, they are wearing through all ready."
1,5,I love this stomp box although I never stomp on it :-)  Needless to say there are a wide variety of reverb available to you.  My amplifier doesn't have reverb so I route the effects send to it and leave it on.  It has just become part of my guitar tone now and wouldn't think about playing without it...
1,5,"You have to look very hard for anything to critique with this pedal; the only think I can think of is moderately high power consumption, so I suggest using the power supply rather than batteries.It is a joy to play almost any style with these, though I prefer jazz/blues sounds generally where the reverb is featured prominently as opposed to tons of distortion.Oh yes .. the clincher is this only costs a tad over 100 bucks. Very hard to find any alternatives that work as well in that price range."
1,5,"Studio grade reverbs in a small box, if you are looking for a reverb with a lot of options and in a small unit this is it.  Another &#34;I can't say enough about it&#34; pedal from TC Electronics, worth checking out if you're looking."
1,5,"This is one of the best pedals I have on my board. I originally thought the reverb on my amp was fine enough but was enticed to try this. I was very pleasantly surprised with the lovely quality of the reverb effect, which can be breathtaking. The settings are all quite useful (Church, plate, spring, hall, room, gate etc) and then you can adjust the amount of the effect and the delay. There is also a toneprint setting which is nice, but honestly, the pedal already has some many ways to adjust the sound, the toneprint seems redundant. I leave this pedal on most of the time - along with my Corona chorus and Flashback delay. It is part of &#34;my sound&#34;."
1,4,"Most the reverb selection sound identical. They all sound good. I would say that the Boss reverb pedal sounds better. I use this pedal in my pedal chain. It doesn't get much action, my amp has a reverb. I was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar."
1,5,No loss of initial tone with this pedal which was #1 on my priority list as I love the sound of my guitar and amp.  The &#34;hall&#34; setting is phenomenal.  Transparent in your signal chain when off as well!  Love it.
1,5,"The best non-rackmount reverb I have ever had.  So many options, clean, transparent, and whisper quiet.  This is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain.  The Toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb.  Excellence once again from TC."
1,5,"Well , at first i was looking for a reverb with a long and deep sound, like a grail or church, then i read about this tone print thing and i really like it, this give you a totally new range of sound based on a specific artist preset, so you can have a bunch of tone prints that you can download from the webpage, the only thing  that could be better is the instructions on how to download the tone prints it doesn't came with the instructions, although is really easy but at first i was blindfolded, but overall it is great."
1,5,"This is the first and only TC Electronic product I've ever purchased.  I watched the Youtube demos and liked what I heard.  It has exceeded my expectations. The reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak. The Toneprint feature is amazing.  I downloaded ""Church of Andy"" preset from the TCE website and just love that patch.  Downloading is quick and easy.  I created a folder on my computer and dowloaded all the available Hall of Fame patches so whenever I want to change it out, I don't even have to go on the Internet to get it.  There is an iPhone/iPod4gen app where you can transfer the patches directly through you guitar to you pedal. Don't ask me how it works, but it does.  I will probably buy more TC Electronic pedals in the future."
1,5,"I compared this side by side with two other reverbs-1) The Boss '63 Fender reverb2) The Electro Harmonix Holy Grail.I found the EH- Holy Grail the most natural sounding and the simplest to operate with only 1 knob and one switch.The TC pedal did sound nice, but to my ears slightly sterile by comparison to the Holy Grail.I thought the Boss pedal sounded pretty bad.Pros of the pedal:- several settings and with all the knobs, highly adjustable- mono or stero (2 inputs, 2 outputs)- standard 9 volt power supply jack used by most pedals- I liked the spring reverb, and the ""mod"" reverb which was lush.Cons:- Sounded a little sterile compared to EH Holy Grail, but close and still good- I thought the number of different reverb settings was actually overkill and just there to look like it did a lot. To my ears, the rest were less distinctive.-Priced at $150, seemed a little high although I know there are other pedals that cost more.Overall a nice pedal, I can't really ding it for the cons above so I still gave it 5 stars. I had to compare a couple times to the EH holy grail to make my decision. In the end, the grail was cheaper, simpler and sounded more like a real reverb tank in my opinion."
0,3,But it's a real step up from the effects on my Vox Mini 5 amp so I'm only going to complain too much.  It actually cost more than the behringer amp I'm running it through which seems a little odd to me.
1,5,"nice reverb pedal, got rid of my boss reverb. the tc pedals are all that is on byboard except my wah and a phase 90, if they made these pedals I'd probablybe all tc electronics! What else can I say!!!!"
1,5,"This is an absolutely amazing Reverb pedal.  TC toneprint is very much a novelty, a very useful one at that if you want to dial in some really nice presets. Where this pedal really shines is in it's endless ability to tweak the parameters using the downloadable editor. You can spend hours finding &#34;Your Sound&#34; or just &#34;The Sound&#34; that you need. High quality chassis, excellent switch and input/output jacks that give a satisfying thunk, indicating your cable is secured.  Don't forget to lift the back panel to adjust the dipswitches to change the true bypass, tone dry through etc... All and all a great one stop reverb pedal with tons of tone and potential that should last a lifetime."
1,5,"I bought this unit because my amp doesn't have reverb. But I discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds. Even when I use a reverbed amp, I turn it off and use my Hall of Fame."
1,5,"really you hate warm, sustaining, natural-tube overdrive; you won't like it at all. This is my favorite OD pedal that I have. I have compared it to the Vox ValveTone OD, the OD side of a EHX Germanium4 BMP, a EHX Linear Power Boost(my second favorite), an Ibanez TS5(90s model) and a Boss Fender Bassman FBM-1. They all have their uses but I find the MojoMojo to be the most versatile, warm and punchy OD I have. I pretty much use it as my base tone to push a lightly crunchy tube amp into overdrive. This thing really wants to sing to you. There are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers. That's not to say it doesn't have some serious punchiness on the low end, which it does; so much that there is a voice switch that will cut the bass a little to keep it from getting too flubby on the neck pickups. I pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers. Single coils really benefit from the round lows this pedal dishes out and I am guessing that's why there is the voice switch.The knobs/pots are nice and the bass/treble pots are notched at 12. Turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts. The drive goes from really clean and subtle, like a  mild boost, up to super drive territory. I actually prefer the sound of this pedal to a Fulltone OCD, it just sounds a little more livelier to me. I really like to push this pedal into the Fender Bassman pedal and get some seriously chimey bell-like highs with a medium crunch by setting it to a mild boost level and upping the gain on the FBM-1, as a third channel of sorts, and it sounds like a totally different amp stack.Like I said, this has become the base of my tone now in just the short amount of time I have had it. I was using the EHX Linear Boost to perform these duties before, and it performs well, but the soulful tone I get from the MojoMojo just adds the extra dimensionality that the pure boost doesn't. I play mostly original compositions but I am going for the Jeff Beck tone and this helps me get where I want to go.Of course none of this means I will stop buying OD pedals... |o)"
1,5,"There really is nothing not to like about this pedal..a) 2 band eq plus voicing switch gives better tonal control than most,b) then drive goes from clean to solid overdrive..c) level control provide from -ve to high +ve boost.With drive set to 3pm and level at 2pm this gives a solid classic rock drive with a les paul and a blues junior.. really nice, roll back the gtr volume and it cleans to a crunch, roll back the drive and control from clean to crunch with the gtr volume.highly recommended.."
1,5,"TC makes very high quality pedals, and this thing is built like a tank. I've had it for over 2 years and done many gigs, and a couple tours and all my TC pedals are in perfect condition. Now for tone, this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when I'm leading worship n my band, we play heavier music, so I was messing around with this overdrive so I could use it there as well, and I discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal, it makes your tone really muddy, but if you send a dirty tone (overdrive or light distortion) into it, it screams beautifully."
1,5,"what can I say, this pedal has never left my pedalboard. is very versitable pedal. from a boast toalmost full out distortion that doesn't loose the sound of the buitar. cool pedal!!!!"
1,4,"I recently picked up the TC Electronic MojoMojo Overdrive at a steal of a price, but I'm evaluating based on its inherent quality relative to the retail price.  I own many different overdrives, including light overdrives in the ""Tubescreamer"", and some ones capable of getting a bit more raucous (Blues Driver, OCD, Joyo Ultimate Drive, etc.).  To me, this is closer to the Tubescreamer family, as it does better as a clean boost or light overdrive.  Actually, the separate knobs for Bass and Treble and its darker tone remind me a bit of the Digitech Bad Monkey.BUILD QUALITY - Outstanding.  It has an ""MXR"" style click button press, but the mechanism feels sturdy and built to last.  The 9V jack is on the top, out of the way of the I/O jacks.  The battery compartment opens with a unique oversized flat screw/button that you can easily get open with your fingers, or maybe a quick turn of a screwdriver.  The thing is dense and build solid as a rock.  I always appreciate the extra weight with pedals because lighter ones are less crush-resistant, and tend to get punted around by your cables.  Finally, the 4 knobs are built will with some force feedback, and several of them are actually notched to settle into the ""12"" position, which is a nice touch.TONE QUALITY - Obviously, the tone quality is the most subjective part of this review.  I would not be at all critical of a reviewer who gave this a ""5"" and absolutely loved it, as several previous reviewers did.  But based on the pedals I have used and my experiences with the MojoMojo, it feels more like a ""4"" to me.  The tone is very warm, almost to the point of being muddy.  Whether the mod switch is a ""boost"" or a ""cut"", the pedal is bassier in the ""up"" position.  Don't get me wrong, I definitely appreciate the abundance of low-end frequencies, but it might get some tweaking to get that high end to shine through.  I could also easily see it getting lost in the mix if you play with other instruments.  It does a nice job of adding a bit of gain and saturation to your tone without coloring it too much with different character.  However, if you'd like a similar effect with a much more expressive (and brighter) output, try the Mad Professor Sweet Honey Overdrive, or its ""clone"" companion, the Joyo Sweet Baby Overdrive.EASE OF USE/VERSATILITY - Many overdrives only have the single tone control, so I was excited to see controls for Bass and Treble.  Still, I feel like this is a pedal that could be great with some amps, and very muddy with others.  I will update my review if my feelings change, as I have a few different combinations I want to try out.  I feel that the preferred use of this pedal is as a stacked overdrive pushing some other type of overdrive or distortion.  This is much the way you would use a Tubescreamer.  I will say that it is one of the more ""tube-like"" overdrives I have tried.  Hit the notes lightly, and you get a clean, transparent tone.  Attack them harder, and the higher output from the guitar will push the overdrive and cause further breakup, much like a tube amp.  However, if your hope is simply to plug into the MojoMojo into a clean amp and expect classic rock tones, you may be a bit disappointed with it as a standalone overdrive pedal."
1,5,"Being a musician I wanted something easy to bring with me to catch the jams.  With the support of this little recorder I have about 95% of what I have played over the last year available to me.Sound Quality - there are many options to select from, sample rate, type (mp3, wav) and a number of other options.  I have mainly recorded wav at 192, when I am done recording I normally will edit it in a DAW and then convert to mp3 for storage.  I would say the audio is good, not great, but certainly right on for what I am doing considering the price.  Power is about 4-6 hours of continuous recording.  I can fit about 3 hours on high quality on the Gb card.  This is usually a little more than I require when jamming.  I have used the USB power when available and that has performed well.I have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels.  Many times at a jam  you don't necessarily get to pick an appropriate vantage point to record everyone equally.  Several times it had to sit next to the drummer, or on the stairs or on the window sill in one case, and I was worried about being able to pick up all the instruments, but on the default settings it seems to pick everyone up and not get saturated.  One instrument may be louder than another but then I tweak it adding compression and eq as necessary to further enhance.The only times it has failed has been I didn't have enough battery, I didn't format the card and it ran out of room or I forgot to press the record button TWICE before recording.  The first arms the track, the second begins the recording.  For the price I bought two and just keep one in my guitar case...  I have not had reason to use the line in for the recorder, just the external mics."

0,3,"This recorder is okay but it's far from perfect. No, I didn't expect it to be perfect but still, I refuse to give it more than 3 stars. It seems to pick up guitar sounds nicely. However, other sounds such as vocals and bass are horrible. I use this to practice with a band, and then I'll just listen to the arrangement later so I can practice by myself. For this much, I have no complaints. Besides that, I would never use this if I wanted a decent quality recording of anything."

I've owned both the H2 and the H1 and, though both have their strong points, the Tascam DR-05 has served me better than either. The H2 has pleasing 4-point sound and the H1, at half the size of the Tascam, works well for ""stealth"" as well as video recordings when mounted on a camera.  But both recorders are more complicated than necessary, with tricky menu systems, excessive tiny buttons (6 on one thin side of the H1), and dicey build quality.The Tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine that's a pleasure to use.  There are no shaky, rattling parts, the controls are solid and instantly solved (easily manageable with a single thumb), and the wide-spread mic pattern is ideal for most stereo recordings of music (for dictation, I use a separate, small mic inserted in the topside input).  The machine reminds me of the far costlier Sony PCM-50 in terms of ease and convenience of operation. The Tascam's 320 kbps MP3 recordings of a grand piano strike my ears as no less authentic and sonically ""present"" than its 96/24 WAV files, and tweaking is held to the absolute minimum.  If you don't have $500 to spend and are looking for a woodshedding companion for day-in, day-out use, this is the one."
1,5,"I got this to compliment my filming of events, concerts etc. After my first test recording, when I played back the audio using the built-in speaker I really thought that I had been duped into believing this device was 'studio quality' ...Then I listened to that same test recording using headphones, and WOW!! This has got to be heard to be believed! There are so many applications for this recorder; it's ease of operation and quick start-up time make it ideal for hurried set-ups."
1,5,i had a dr-07 that i loved but it mysteriously walked out during a gig we played at a local bar.  i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less.  i never used the reverb or overdubbing capabilities of the dr 07 anyway and i usually used it with the mics folded in.  i have recorded several rehearsals with this one and i cant tell a difference between the recordings i made with the dr 07 and the recordings from this one.  this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals.
1,4,This is not top of the line but for the price is a good deal.  I don't think it lastforever but it works great for my Peavey Patriot Guitar. I would recommend this toanyone looking for an inexpensive way to transport a guitar.
1,4,"I purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive Epiphone Les Paul Jr, which fits perfectly (as does a Squier Strat.)On the plus side, the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some (but not a lot) of abuse.The reason I claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear. That should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this. One other issue I've had with the case is I left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges, especially the lip around the top of the case. Again, this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot, enclosed space for prolonged periods.For inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument. It is perfect for occasional gigging, but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road. I would not hesitate to purchase another one if I acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because I do like the better protection this particular case provides."
0,2,"I ordered one of these (from MF) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work.  Even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case.  But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing.  As for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed.  The other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.Disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case.  The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag.  It also won't stand evenly on end (if that's important to you).On the positive side it's light, it does fit a Telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment.  But do yourself a favor and spend another $25 and get something better.  I have a Musician's Gear dreadnought case and this doesn't compare to that one at all."
1,5,this is a great value. i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series. it fits perfectly. thank you
1,5,This is a great guitar case and a great price. I bought it to keep my Fender Strat in and it works great.
1,4,Like many here the case could be an inch bigger.  For my Ibanez 510  I cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back.  Now mine closes without pressure on the bridge.
1,4,"We have my grandpa's really old Mandolin now, so my dad and I wanted a nice case for our 70 year old mandolin. I saw this case and thought that maybe it would work. Well it works just fine, the mandolin is a little bit more deep than the case but it still works and closes well.Now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there!"
1,5,"I couldn't believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price. Especially given what I paid for it, this case is unbelievable... velvety cushioning inside, heavy-duty outside, and a little compartment for picks or capos (I can't fit much else in there but I don't really need to). A few other reviewers have mentioned that it can be a squeeze -- at first, I didn't think my Ibanez mandolin fit in here, but when I finally applied some pressure, it went right in. Now that I've been using the case for a while it seems broken in, and I don't have to fight it so much to get it to close.The only downside is that after a few uses, the outer black layer of the case started peeling off at the edge. I used some electrical tape to stick it back on there and since it's on the bottom, it's not very noticeable, but that was the one place where the low price kind of showed through. I didn't take a star away for that as it's purely cosmetic, and as long as this thing is protecting my mandolin, I can forgive some tape on the edge. In this case, I still got more than my money's worth."
1,5,"It's a good quality case. I wouldn't check it as luggage when flying, but it's small so bring it as a carry-on. It'll protect your mando just fine."
1,5,"I got one of those for my next mandolin after my Johnson. I couldn't see spending 40 bucks for a case for a 50 dollar instrument, so I didn't. However, the next one cost a few hundred and I got one of these cases that has served me well. These are pretty soft inside and fit most A-styles pretty well. The hardware is decent but I wouldn't expect the hinges to last forever. They'll be easy enough to fix/replace when they fall off, so no worries there.If I had a $2500.00 Gibson/Weber/Whatever, I wouldn't buy this, I'd spend the money for a really nice case, but since I don't, I didn't. If you DO have an expensive instrument and want to cheap out, these really are decent little cases but you won't mistake it for a really expensive one, and that's fine.If it's still built like my case (never can tell these days...) it'll have a little storage compartment that will hold a bunch of pics, capo and a little tuner with no problem. Not big enough for a strap though with everything else in there."
1,5,"I order this for my Glen Burton cutaway. I had it in a gig bag, but acoustic guitars shouldn't be in a gig bag. I got tired of my guiitar being banged around in the back of the car so I ordered this hardshell case. It is wonderful. Very well made and beautiful. It came to me right on time with no problems at all. It also has a lock on it so you can lock your guitar up so no one will get in to it. It is a little heavy, but that is something I can get use to. My guitar fit perfetly in it and is very snug. I love this case and it is worth every dime you pay for it, maybe even more."
1,5,"I am the kind of guy that fixes everything with duct tape and when the item is more tape than product I go to a pawn shop and buy something used and start the process again. I saw this case and thought 50 bucks and it's for my favorite guitar, so I purchased it. 2 days later it was sitting at my back door (and I didn't have to pay shipping). This thing is a beauty! Plush interior, hardware looks great and good quality. Does not use the cheap spring latches but rather the locking type. Deep storage pocket and more. My 12 string fits in it w/room to spare and its' case is running out of room to tape so I guess I'll be purchasing another soon."
0,3,"The odor of adhesive lingered for some time, but that's not really a problem.Size and fit were good. The storage compartment is nice and large.One hinge broke after about a year of normal use. It was in the house almost the whole time, I just open the case to play the guitar and then replace it when done. I noticed if you look carefully, one of the hinges is cracked on both sides, so it is not holding anything anymore, but it is one of three, so the other two still do the job just fine. It is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured.This was not an expensive guitar, and I had a better case, so I switched to the better guitar case, and used this one for another guitar that I really don't play at all, and it just stays in storage."
1,5,"I bought this guitar case for wife, as she plays a acoustic guitar and needed to replace her &#34;GIG bag( soft case) with a hard case that would protect her guitar better than the soft case could. She absolutely loves the case and it is well built and when you use it, it makes you think that this case should cost more, but for the $60, it is an awesome deal.The case fits her acoustic like a glove and has a storage compartment for her Mic cable, DI box , picks and tuner. Underneath the neck, there is enough space for storage of two sets of extra guitar strings. You  might pay more for a NAME brand case...save some money for soemthing else an dget this case, because it is a great deal. We found nothing negative that we could say about it. It also was packaged VERY well to protect the case during shipment and came very quick."
1,5,"I honestly don't know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too. I've seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more. This is a hard shell tolex covered case. They are sturdy, well padded with plush black lining, and look as good as cases costing much more. These cases are made for dreadnought guitars, and I bought two of them. One is for my Ibanez AK75G arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly. The case has 4 brass latches and one is lockable and comes with 2 keys. It's made in China, but isn't most everything these days? I wouldn't recommend it for airline/railroad baggage, but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions. I don't think you'll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else. Don't be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better. Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases!"
1,4,"I bought this recently for $40 to replace the old cardboard case my acoustic had been in for decades.  For $40 it's an awesome deal.  But objectively, when compared to an Epiphone 335-style case I bought last year for $81, it's deserving of 4 stars (which isn't bad, just not great):PROS:  Decent build quality; four buckles (one locking) and three hinges; very nice plush lining; not heavy; knobs on bottom so it stands on end; knobs on side and back so it's never directly on the floor; fits a dreadnaught well.CONS:  Not easy to close and takes some work to get all the buckles lined up and snapped shut; the one locking buckle wouldn't stop anyone; the big front and back body panels flex more than they should; exterior covering feels somewhat cheap; the handle is hard plastic and not padded.So for $40 it's a great deal and a big step up from unlined cardboard, but it doesn't measure up to a basic Epi 335 case which is stronger and has better hardware and finishes.  It also had a strong chemical odor, but leave it open to air out for a while and that mostly goes away."
1,5,"Exceptionally well made, this is a fantastic case for the money. (Fifty dollars, including shipping, at the time of my purchase.) It has four(!) very solid clasps, one of which locks. (Two keys are included.) It also features a plush velvet interior, cushioned neck brace, and a strap to keep the top from flopping back, which could stress the hinges and perhaps alter the factory-perfect lid to case alignment. But best of all, it fits my Takamine Jasmine guitar like a glove, holding it secure and (knock on wood) keeping it safe from all harm. I could not be happier."
1,5,"It fits well, close well, protects well, transport well! What more can I ask from a guitar case that cost a fraction of the other cases.  Have not have it that long to rate the durability but I like this case."
1,4,"I wasn't sure about spending a lot of money on a guitar since I was just starting out.  I bought this to work with Rocksmith 2014 and it did the job just fine.  The guitar needed some work to get it properly set up since tuning it straight out of the box sounded horrible.  It turns out that the intonation needed to be set properly and also the strings that it came with are garbage.I put new strings on it and fixed the intonation, adjusted the truss rod a bit and adjusted the string height (all with just the tools that they provided with the guitar) and it sounded a lot better. Unfortunately there's no 22nd fret on this guitar.  That probably shouldn't come as a big surprise as a lot of stratocaster type guitars only have 21 frets, but there's this one song that requires me to bend the high e string on the 22nd fret...The single coil pickups have quite a bit of hum on them so for rocksmith you kinda have to calibrate it a few times to make sure that it doesn't pick up much of that hum, or else you resort to using the 2nd and 4th switch setting so that it uses two pickups at once which cancels out the hum.I think if you wanted to try modding your guitar this would probably be a decent choice too.  I haven't gotten that far yet.  I've had it since February, changed strings on it twice (in 4 months) and so far it's proven to be a fairly nice little guitar to learn on...except for that 22nd fret (oh well)."
1,4,"All guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there. They vary a bit, but basically you have a light, 3 pickup, versitale guitar that does that job - that is about it. But this Legacy, which I can see as I am typing, is much more.First, the natural finish is what got me started. It seems that a natural finish is about as rare as a news web site without video ads. I looked at $700+ Fenders, but except for the natural finish - what was I getting for $700? I wanted a strat copy that I could customize - this is IT!. I am putting split hot rail-type pickups in this, and WOW I have a strat, 3-pickup LP, and anything in between.Get one!"
1,5,"1. If you are totally a beginner and have nothing to begin with, get this guitar and a Vox amplug AC30. Use it with your headphones or home speakers.2. Don't upgrade until your skills improved and you become a mid level. Prepare $1000 for a tube amp and a good guitar with brand name pickups for upgrade. If your budget is below that, don't bother and save more.Speak from experience, I've tried a lot and did many research. This guitar with amplug just sound amazing! Plus, it can be your forever play around set which you will be happy with and bring them out. Guitars and amps below $400, yes there are good stuff, but you're more likely to get problematic things that will be replace by better things latter. For a budget around $1000, if you don't go professional, you will be happy with them forever. So do yourself a favor, one shot, no waste of time and money.This guitar is good enough for any beginners. Most under $400 guitars don't have good pickups, so why spend extra money? (Again, my bloody experience taught me that.I've spent time and money, way more than $1000) Free advice.I strongly recommend this guitar, it has no fault towards its price."
1,5,"Not knowing much, and after using for a couple of months, I'm pretty happy with guitar for the money I paid for it.  Fit and finish is quite nice.  Just needed tuning.  Great beginner model.  Feels solid and stay's in tune after the first 4 or 5 practice sessions."
1,5,"I ordered the telecaster version and received this strat version by mistake BUT I liked this so much I decided to keep this one, reorder the telecaster version so I can have that too.  The body is very solid, beautiful finish (mine is a sunburst color).  For $79.95 this is a must buy. You will not be sorry. I have 3 fender type strats and this one is now my favorite. It's great for recording. I just bought a Zoom G5 and it works great with that.  The tones are rich and warm.  I agree with others that the quality is similar to strats costing $399 and more.  It fits so well in my hands and feels great. I love this guitar!!"
1,5,"I figured I'd buy a cheap second guitar, so I found this one. One of the cheapest prices on Amazon. And I thought wow, what a great look this guitar has. I was also hoping that it played well. Well I've been playing it for a while and it still sounds pretty good, and I've had no technical issues what so ever. I would recommend to ANYONE. Keep up the good work! =)"
1,5,"I acquired this recently, I did not need another strat style, or copy of, but it's white....just gotta love that vibe? Anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good, here's a few add ons in case... It's routed hsh under the hood but looks tight.. Think it's bucker size upgradable; top and bottom didn't measure, I like single coils...the white is a poly finish (love poly durable and crack/fade resist) and exquisite nicely done, alder body but it's hefty alder, like 8lb or so. Not so keen on headstock shape but the neck is nice, too nice to change like I was thinking till I got it... Nice quality control on these, really smooth rosewood board with med-jumbo (that's what I call anyway) frets good fretting. Standard hardware indicative of price but decent and well installed, no missed screw holes etc. Was set up with standard action etc, out of box was clean set up no buzz or uneven saddle stuff etc. great fit and finish, best I can tell its a standard f type plate, if interested looks to be easy changer.Overall it's a solid piece, assembled well, for me the body and neck is what seals the deal, better then most out there this range... It is alder and hefty, but durable. I look to change most hardware in time so won't comment on that, what's there... is installed well...2 things I forgot tuners wanna say 15:1? 10mm standard import style... Seem good, not legendary and tremelo/whammy standard zinc block (there's the must upgrade part...) it's standard 10.5 string space import, I got one pet peave; it's steel or brass blocks... A shame all these guitars nowadays with the zinc thin low sustain blocks, my advice get a fender mim standard lefty trem, the whole thing with steel saddles and all maybe 50$ best money ever spent... I can't afford the gotoh or Callahan stuff, On this a standard mim import space fender with steel block and saddles is easy direct replacement and with the hefty alder you'll get tons of sustain and tone and keep tuned way better. Also the neck I say nice but I mean it's nicer than most in the shape, it's slightly chunky c shape? Not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 1-3 it's beefier? I have avg. size hands, I find it's a good fit.In all... If your looking in this price range it's nice, and upgradable as you can or learn more."
1,5,This is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for 300$ bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers.
1,5,"I am truly amazed at the quality of this guitar! I got the natural finish and I am blown away at the beauty of this thing! Mine arrived in perfect condition. Will only need a minor setup. The intonation was surprisingly spot on and the strings are actually alright to practice on for a while. If you are looking for a great quality strat for under 90 bucks, then don't hesitate and order one of these babies!"
0,1,"Right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off (fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp). After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. Next, I proceeded to adjust the intonation. I was able to get the intonation for the A, D, G, B, and high-E strings spot on. However, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.I love the Red Burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it. I'm going to get a Squier Strat instead (with either aMapleorRosewoodneck).---[Update November 15, 2013]I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until December. Then, to my surprise, the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday! Yay!! :D The happiness!!I was able to get the Squier perfectly intonated. It's Red Burst like the Legacy (Fender calls it Antique Burst). It's a beautful guitar and and I'm loving it!"
1,5,This is a good guitar for the price. Played well right out of the box. The finish is beautiful and I found no defects. Sounds good and well worth the money.
1,5,"This Is one great piece. The quality of the guitar is Amazing!!! and for Its price Outstanding!! It plays Beautifully with my 100w amp. And with my experience of guitars, this is a go getter, otherwise I would see this one stand out to a $300 Les Paul!!!"
1,5,"I don't know if 39"" (from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body {I know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that} ) is the normal size for an adult...However for $50 (its on sale at the time) even if its not I can still learn to play since thats why I bought it is to learn...The pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesn't really affect anything, since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fine.All togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty good.I am happy with it.Good clean sound, at least with my headphone amp (only amp I have).Comes with Whammy bar(thats what I know it as), one volume, two tone, the pickup sector switch, the cord that connects your guitar to your amp.**EDIT**So now that Amazon has grouped the guitar with many others (mostly the color differences) and that I have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar, not saying much really but a little bit, I have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume... Not much of an issue, for me at least but worth mentioning."
1,4,"I have been using Olympus VN-7100 for recording piano and singing sessions, and I want to upgrade it to DR-O7MKII for stereo and connecting to computer. It has more features for me to learn new songs rather than recording tasks. Used it few times to record piano and singing recitals and practices.  The sounds is amazing, and it is much better than VN-7100, and the price is worth to spend.  I haven't fully utilized it yet and didn't have time to study the menu completely, so I just checked the menu whatever I need at this stage.  So far, I am happy for what I got the recording quality from this guy.The build is light, which is good, but its plastic material is kinda cheap as most reviewer commented, and the size is bulky, and I think it can be shorten as DR-40, too bad I don't need 4 channels yet even though I can use it for guitar practices and session.  Ended up I picked DR-07MKII for slightly less $$ ...Bought it for my x'mas gift and got a promotion of $15 rebate at that time. I mailed whatever is needed for the rebate to the vendor for almost 3 weeks, but I still haven't gotten any notice from the vendor.  Besides that, the vendor requests to cut the bar code label from the original box with a filled form for the rebate, which make me dislike.  If they don't rebate to me, and I can't return it neither since the original was cut & trashed!  feel like it's a tricky rebate ..."
1,4,"This unit works as advertised.  I've used it to record my garage band shows.  Making a simple recording and transferring it to a computer for storage and playback is easy to accomplish for a novice.  Buyers should bear in mind that the unit records ambient sounds (e.g., audience and any other background noise), so if you want a more pure sound, you should record directly to a computer through a mixer or other interface to instruments, microphones, etc."
1,5,"If your a musician (or want to be?) recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well. I have found recording to be extremely important to my ability to learn new songs and that having been said, you cannot beat a Tascam recorder for ease of operation, features and sound quality. Enough said, buy a Tascam if you serious about your music."
0,3,"The use of the device was moderately difficult.  The primary difficulty was in the how the user's manual was written.  The information is not straight forth, and the ""how to"" especially on setting up the device was severely lacking.  This left me to the old plug and chug method.  Once I figured out how to set it up...I found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker.  The DR did sound better with ear buds, but still was short of what I expected based on the reviews on Amazon and other websites.  The good things though is that it is light, portable and the mics can be moved.  I wasn't expecting bose type of sound, but I wasn't expecting to hear the tin man either."
1,5,"I waited a few weeks to get used to the recorder before reviewing it, I didnt want to be like some of the other reviewers who gave a first impression review based of their lack of understanding.It works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas...$12 16GB Sandisc cards work great as long as you understand it only records up to 2gb at a time, but the Tascam will jump to next 2gb if it runs over only causing a few second skip.... it sounds good natural and spacias...get it...I paid $110 shipped for mine, so look on Amazon or Ebay for purchase...the big music stores always mark up the prices very HIGH...zzounds, musicians friend sweetwater music 123, dont buy from them...Jim"
0,1,"Just use a smartphone to record stuff. This is a really weird, not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones. Not really worth the $75 - I returned mine."
1,5,"I bought this in 2012 to record music classes and workshops that I take in both acoustic / fingerstyle guitar as well as electric guitar, bass and percussion.  All of those environments are very different and require different approaches otherwise you'll wind up with only mumbling or with the sound blown out.  The DR-07MKII has worked well for over 100 classes recorded.This unit has been great for picking up the human voice about 20 feet away while it has been sitting on an extra tilted music stand.  With it set to auto level then I can take it to a loud percussion class or electric band class and it quickly adjusts itself to the environment.You can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually.  I've needed to do that for classes that involved a lot of lectures but then bursts of high sound.  I was willing to let the bursts clip so that I didn't miss the human speaking around them.One little feature that I now love is the fact that you can preset the file names and it uses them followed by a number to create next file.  I set them for certain venues that take classes or even a class name if I know that I'm going to be taking only that class for a few weeks.  This makes it easy to copy to my PC and keep organized."
1,5,"I purchased this product a few weeks ago after reviewing and ""kicking"" the tires of this one and it's competition.  I will tell you up front my decision to buy the DR-07MKII over the Zoom H1 came down to the inclusion of a guitar tuner and the ability to be a phrase trainer!  I'm a musician and a wanna-be videographer, since the quality of captured sound was the same on each test I read about (DR-07MKII vs Zoom H1) and listened too on YouTube I decided the tuner would keep my gig bag the same size.Most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians.  Tascam makes a line of phrase trainers that typically cost between $150-200 and don't even have high quality microphones, so discovering I could toss an MP3 of the song I was learning and slow it down to figure out the chords and lead guitar parts was an unexpected surprise. This is the better choice for musicians.Other features I appreciate about the DR-07MKII, the adjustable microphones, quick turn on and being armed to record, the file system, the low battery consumption.I should also mention that straight out of the box i attempted to record, after all, everyone said how easy it was to simply open it up, power it up and start recording.  Well, I got a recording without sound!  The unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero.  Once I figure that out all was right again in my universe.  You will want to start with a recording level that is high and adjust lower to suite your recording situation.  I found out the hard way how much of a waste of time it was to start low first, a few of my early attempts at recording our church worship team practice was disappointing.  The more aggressive recording level solved that problem.I purchased a standard microphone windscreen for it, after the first time or two of stretching it on with some difficulty the windscreen loosened up enough to make it a simple process.  I have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results. I still don't know how I will solve the  wind noise issue when recording ambient sound (microphone capsules facing out) since the windscreen will only cover the microphones in the XY pattern position.  I'm sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though.For my video work I use inexpensive hd capable camcorders. My new fascination is with the Song Bloggie (swivel camera lense), they are inexpensive now ($50 on Craigslist these days) and with the DR-07MKII all my video pieces have wonderful sound to go along with the surprisingly good picture quality I get from the Bloggie.One last detail, at the point of purchase I discovered Amazon was doing a special on my purchase and discounted the DR-07MKII to the same price point as the Zoom H1... win win!  I got what I expected with my purchase, you will too."
1,4,"This is probably obvious to more experienced musicians, but for Amateur musicians (like me), If you think that you know how your audience hears you because you listen through your monitor while you play, then you're fooling yourself.  You have to listen to your mix by recording it, then listening while you're not playing/singing."
1,5,"I could never see myself buying a dedicated compressor, reverb pedal, harmonizer, ring modulator, etc.  The Line 6 M5 seemed like a good way to have a ""jack-of-all-trades"" pedal on my board for those times I needed one specialized effect.  I have to say that it serves that purpose in spades.I have an all-analog board and was reluctant to have anything digital on it based on past experience with modelers.  I was wrong to worry; digital has come a long way.  Almost all of the effects sound great to my ear, especially into a tube amp.  True bypass means no tone suck to boot.High points for the delays, reverbs, and mods.  I am not a fan of all of the drives but the Overdrive and Boost Comp sound pretty awesome.  The Rat model ""Classic Distortion"" sounds exactly like my ProCo Rat2.  Wish I could say the same for the Big Muff model but I guess they couldn't get them all right.The only issue is I liked it so much I could not resist the urge to get the M9 so I can run three effects simultaneously.  However, if you need a pedal to fill in for those times when you need a certain single effect the M5 is a winner."
0,2,"I was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time, good though they were. Too expensive foronly one effect at a time. Returned it."
1,5,"Make sure you get a Diago power supply or one that can deliver more than 500MA the one sent from Line6 is only 250MA, huge error from L6!"
1,4,"I decided to try out the M5 in order to add some more effects options while replacing a tuner and analog delay on my pedal board. While I haven't explored all of the sounds yet, I have found some useable ones.You really need to start off by finding and dialing in the effects you like and creating your own presets. Flipping through all of the categories and individual effects is not really practical for any live performance situation. Also, factory settings are almost never where you need them to be on these devices because the source signals from different instruments vary so much.Here are some that I've personally found to be appealing so far:Delay: Analog w/Mod- a nice sounding Memory Man style delay once you dial it in to not overwhelm your source signalReverb: Room- standard adjustable digital delay, not truly authentic by any stretch but does the trick when played over other musicEnvelope Filter: Tron Up- a Winner! fully functional and authentic envelope follower, FUNKY!Synthy: Seeker- a very cool filter for single guitar notes.Octave: Bass Octaver- One note below only but quite effective especially for loopers.You will also find (as expected with a multi-effects pedal) many unpractical, downright silly-sounding noise makers. Not to say you won't find a use for them here or there but they really exist as filler unless we're talking about a 4:20 headphones session ;) Also, don't depend on any strong distortions from this unit unless you're using it as an addition to your amp's lead channel.Construction seems pretty sturdy other than the ""Model Select"" button which is a multi-use knob with push-down / turn action and is cheapy-cheap. It's awkward and uncomfortable to use, fortunately you only really need it while setting the unit up. I already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets.Having the choice between True-Bypass and DSP is a really nice touch (and unheard of on stomp boxes) as people have different needs here depending on your signal chain.The tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position. I do miss my KORG Pitchblack with its big bright display but this one does the trick and saves me another pedal connection.I personally wanted things like octave, envelope, phaser, etc. available to me on stage without having to buy and wire in all those pedals for occasional use individually. The M5 is serving that purpose. The sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist. They should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone. Just a large bank of fun accents to add here and there in a very manageable and affordable package."
1,5,"This single pedal unit has a lot of  amazing and suprising effects. A lot of overdrive/distortions, filters, modulations, delays, reverbs, all carefully modeled. I put M5 side-by-side with the &#34;real one&#34; with a A/B switch, and don't heard differences. I'm using in musics where I need programed delays (like U2 or Pink Floyd) or when I need a specific effect - I only use Tremolo in 1 music, and this gear help me to save my money."
1,5,"I really like the delays and the reverbs on this pedal, i recomend this model, it will work if you need a lot of effects in one box, it really sounds great, the distortions sounds great too."
1,5,"When I bought this pedal I was thinking a heavy distortion. But when I got it and played with it I figured out it was alot different that advertised. It is a acdc, Steve Vaughn kind of pedal. It's got an attitude but it soft at the same time. It's truly a one of a kind product. I would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal. Make a note it is not a metal pedal. Not by any means actually. But for what it is it is fantastic."
1,4,Cool pedal on a clean amp. I ran it into my dual gain amp and it just muddied the sound up. I am buying an old twin head that I want to try this on for a little vintage grit. I think it will work great for that.
1,5,"I usually stickup to the OverDrive pedals, asking tons of sound from tubes and extra overdrives. Still, I needed a Distortion that could cover of the Marshall sound-like roar JCM-800... and this guy did the job! It's not a Riot, but... pretty much defends its self from the old 70-80s songs. Love it!"
1,4,"Like the name implies some very cool sounding 70's distortions, not overbearing so your pickups and amp tone still stay in their, I like the mod switch in the top left corner, sounds good with my compressor infront (MXR).  so ez to use and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and to last"
1,5,"Great overdrive/distortion for classic rock music.  Good volume roll off tones , at full bore it sounds like VH, and some other 80s rock dudes. It's quiet and has a very active tone control. The crunch switch adds a touch of high end harmonic , not too much but just enough. MXR has come around to making pedals that do what they say they will do. I now own  a Script Phase 90, and a Micro Chorus as well and plan on getting others. I'm a classic rock player these pedals have a classic 60s + vibe."
1,5,"I bought this pedal wanting classic distortion and find it more useful as an overdrive pedal. The distortion range does not get as hot as a RAT or MXR classic distortion but it sounds great with a telecaster and tube amp. I use it with a cigar box guitar also for fun and the tone ranges from 60's and 70's distortion to 80's metal. I get a more extreme distortion from my old hissing Boss Mega Distion as an example.I like that the pedal has a wide array of uses. The build quality seems questionable from MXR. As others have posted, the box is very light and the knobs seem thinner than other MXR's, espeacially the older ones, but this pedal seems solid and makes no noise.The price and demo videos were the primary reason I bought this pedal and I am happy with it. I have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way. I would steer clear of this if you are looking for a pedal for metal and definately buy it if you are into classic rock, twang, and blues."
0,1,"Well... it's not really too expensive, but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it.  Even the crunch button is just a louder sound?  Not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for.  Guess that's why it's so cheap."
1,4,"If you are looking to spend not too much on a distortion pedal, in my opinion this is the one to get. There are a few more different models and brands that are good. But, i could use this pedal no matter what style of music i'm playing and not feel like i have to sell it if i start a new project."
1,5,"Wanted to review this pedal because I felt some of the other reviews were a little lukewarm.  Distortion is incredibly subjective-it depends on your rig and your tastes. But the Badass '78 by MXR is a very nice pedal for a decent price.  It doesn't do metal or super high-gain, but offers some nice classic rock tones and can be quite warm if you back off on the tone knob. The crunch button adds brightness and volume and may or may not be too harsh for your setup.  However, the tone knob does do a pretty good job of rolling back the high end, especially if you activate the ""crunch"" button.The build quality seems to be pretty good, though I should note that while the pedal is the same size as other MXR pedals, it is significantly lighter.  I suppose this could make it more susceptible to denting and damage if it travels, but it should be plenty durable for 95% of users.  I really like the switch on this one too, it's easy to press and clearly clicks ""on"" once depressed.  One minor annoyance if you use the ""crunch"" setting is that the blue light (which is annoyingly bright like an LED headlight) stays on EVEN when the pedal itself is off.  This can be quite distracting if you rely on the lights on your pedal board to tell you which effects are on.  Not really a major gripe that detracts from the pedal's quality, but a frustrating design decision.Basically, if you get the right setup, you'll get great tone.  I got this pedal specifically to try and find a better alternative to the BOSS DS-1, which lacks mids and can sound harsh/abrasive.  The MXR '78 Badass is definitely superior in that regard, but a lot will depend on your rig and settings.  I find that this pedal really excels on playing single notes on the lower strings (think ""Walk this Way"" by Aerosmith, or ""Hangingaround"" intro by Counting Crows).  And if you pair it with a fat tubescreamer or other overdrive pedal, you could probably thicken it up a bit for higher solos.  Great pedal!"
1,5,"Not every tune needs tremolo I grant you, but when you need one, this will do the job and them some. Simple controls. The LED pulses with the beat of the unit giving you a visual of the unit's settings at all times. 100% silent switching. In a FX loop, there's not a trace of hiss, hum, or noise in any form. In a chain running into an amp's input, there is a slight volume increase. Not much, but a little. No big deal really, unless you're a real tone freak. There is no change in tone or any form of loss when in use. Being a true bypass, it changes nothing when off either. The box is ultra solid. The jacks are all metal. The switch is stout. In short, this is a solid performing pedal that gives a nice clean, warm, tremolo that cannot be beat at three times the cost of this unit. It it anchored to my board! It is not going to come off because it's that good. Besides, how can you turn down a deal like this and get a pedal that has a crouching pitbull on it???"
1,5,"I purchased this pedal recently, a bit skeptical with such a low price tag; however, I was completely impressed with it. I don't use a tremolo effect often, but when I do I just need some subtle, shimmering swells. This box does the trick. Construction wise it is housed in an all metal chasis. The knobs feel sturdy enough and the button seems strong - by the way, it is true bypass which is nice. It doesn't seem to affect my tone when I kick it on, no volume or tone changes, just the tremolo effect. And, silly enough, the yellow paint looks cool on my pedal board. I don't know if I will purchase other joyo effects, but I am impressed with this one. 5 stars."
1,4,"This is a very good piece of equipment for its price. Used mildly, it gives the sound a more natural feel."
0,2,"It is built like a tank, but it quit working after a couple of weeks. I haven't made time trouble shoot it yet, so I'm not sure what component has failed."
1,4,"Pretty cool knock-off of the Schaller trem or Diaz Tremodillo. This is my 2nd or 3rd Joyo pedal, and my favorite thus far. I don't care for the cheap jacks, but you get what you pay for, and I can always replace them if they break (I work on pedals all the time).I've got a scratchbuilt improved EA Trem (with two footswitchable speeds) and a cheap little Danelectro Tuna Melt. Other than the crummy bypass and plastic construction, the Tuna Melt is my favorite since it has the hard/soft switch. The improved EA has a great preamp for guaranteed unity gain (or more), and the footswitchable speeds that I added gives it extra flexibility. But I think the Joyo trumps it by just a little bit in that the core trem sound is a nice blend of the Tuna Melt's hard and soft settings.So part of this is really a subjective take on this flavor of trem, but suffice it to say if you've tried a few, this one will probably satisfy you at least a bit. No unity gain issues, and the speed and depth have a good sweep throughout their ranges.And it's just a niggle, but how hard would it be to get the word &#34;tremolo&#34; silkscreened so that it's centered on the box? At least there's no skull and flames like on the High Gain Distortion."
1,4,"This pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from. From subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only $40! And it's built tough like a good effects pedal should be: full metal case and solid construction, an all around great buy"
0,1,This product is bad quality because the noise it makes. It increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all. I'm going to sell this product. I didn't like it.
1,5,"The joyo tremolo is awesome, best for the buck. It's just as good as any, I love the joyo pedals. affordable and doesn't break the bank"
1,5,"For most guitarists, tremolo is a very simple effect.  You simply want a pedal to control swells or oscillations in volume to give your tone a ""shimmering"" effect.  It's used in subtle fashion in everything from to 50's/60's rock and surf guitar to modern ""indie"" rock.  But most guitarists (like me) were never going to shell out $100 (or more) for a Boss or other expensive tremolo option.  In fact, there really weren't that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market.Enter the Joyo JF-09 Tremolo.  This pedal is simple, durable, affordable ($40 - $45), and it just works.  The only two controls are for Intensity (depth of the volume swells) and Rate (how fast the swells cycle).  The LED light dims rhythmically along with the ""Rate"" control, which is a nice visual indicator.As for the sound - the pedal sounds great.  It doesn't color or diminish your tone in any way.  I'm not a ""tremolo expert"", but the effect sounds as it should.  If you're the type to obsess over tremolo, then you probably aren't looking to save money anyway, and there are $200 boutique options from Catalinbread and others that have tap input and other features.  I'm not particularly interested in those, so the lack of those on the Joyo won't detract from my score.Regarding the quality and durability of Joyo pedals, there's a lot of discussion about that, but also some misinformation.  I've personally owned 7 of them at one point or another (yes, I like them that much), and I've yet to have one fail.  The early run of Joyo pedals is actually quite durable, and includes the JF-09 Tremolo and every pedal numbered from JF-01 through JF-17.  The more recent models numbered higher than that are all similar in appearance, and while many of them still sound great, they feel lighter, ""cheaper"", and the switch is a little more suspect.  I recommend ordering through a vendor that ships from the U.S., rather than trying to save a few bucks on a direct shipment from China.  Many of the U.S. vendors will test the pedal out before shipping it, which is a huge advantage.Highly recommended!"
1,5,"These work great.For the price I bought a couple intending to use them on a diddley bow I built.I have not used them for that purpose yet, but tried them on my guitars, a dulcimer and stick I built, and was impressed with the sound quality for the price."
0,3,"This device works well, but sound is far from perfect. Distortion is more noticeable at higher volume. For the price paid is a very reasonable option."
1,4,"not the greatest little pick up, for the price im more than happy with its performance.  put it through a highr quality mixer and there are no problems, run it through a practice amp and it comes off a bit tinny.  I wont fit in the sound hole to I clip it to the head stock and it works surprisingly well.  Cant beat it for the price."
1,4,"I like how easy it can be attached to the soundhole, or, for that matter, to the headstock, where you may get less feedback than with the soundhole. It works well but produces a somewhat metallic sound, not quite true to your guitar (you will note this in particular with a classical guitar). This can be balanced, to some degree with your amp's equalizer and/or the treble and bass settings. However, compared to the AXL Pickup (which I bought for comparison), the Cherub is suboptimal when it comes to the sound it produces. It is not bad, but it does not reach the quality of the AXL. Both are inexpensive enough that you may buy them together and see what you like best. The Cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar."
0,1,"DOWNGRADE TO 1-O STAR AFTER RETURNING IT BACK TO BROOKMAYS, THE SELLER:I am really disappointed by the seller, BrookMays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective Cherbub Guitar Pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue.  After two weeks of the returned item was delivered, I didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap.  Too bad, four days after the email had been sent, I only got the email of telling me the case# of the message I sent without any further response to my refund.  until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and I don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. Therefore, yesterday, I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still haven't heard from the seller shorty.Today, I finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, ""it was not defective. All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar. The feedback can be to to many other issues. I have issued the refund of $7.04.""  Obviously, the reply is unconvincing; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues, i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups, but it doesn't have such problems at all.  The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didn't try many pickups.  Cherub Guitar Pickup doesn't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises.  Moreover, the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying, and there's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming. Indeed, I won't use it, and I don't want it to sit at my house as a useless property, so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has.  However, the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it's NOT worth at all.By the way, I'm also unhappy about the refund of &7.04, I bought it for $8.79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $25 or more.  To me, it is not the money of $1.75, but it's not fair to the buyer, who doesn't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter. So if you really need a pickup for your instrument, I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one. Don't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price, in turn, you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise.  I don't want that happens to anyone else, so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it.2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE:I like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings.  Besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description ""regardless the surrounding noises.""  I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises.  One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use, and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. However, when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either.  I don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got ... I bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, I can't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. So, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, BrookMays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description. Good Luck then!"
1,5,I bought this for the other half of my duet to use on there guitar and mandolin .They had there doubts about how good it would sound and if it would feedback.Well surprise surprise surprise it didn't feedback and it sounds great.I would recommend this product.
1,5,this was for a friend who liked the way the guitar pikup worked that he ordered 2 more for his family members.
1,5,"I have a couple of clip on mics that I tried out.  This one is definitely the best.  I use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke.  You do have to find the sweet spot, but once you do, it works great through my Pignose amp, and actually fits right inside my Pignose.  Great value and price too!"
1,5,"After purchasing many kinds of attachments to amplify my mandolin or fiddle, with little or no satisfaction, I ordered this little mic.  I didnt' expect much considering the price.  It works so great, I ordered a few more.  Clip it into the guitar sound hole, or on the head stock, or on the mandolin head stock or on the fiddle....each time, it delivers a natural pleasant sound, not distorted or squeaky. The cord is long enough for me to stand and move around some while I play.  that is a GREAT bonus for me!!"
1,5,Very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it!!!!!! I would recommend this product to a friend!
1,5,"I really like the Cherub pickup. It is the easiest to install in my classical guitar of any pickup I've used. The sound quality is very good for a piezo pickup and better than at least one of the more complicated bar type in the sound hole type pickups I have. The pick wire out to the amp is skinny and only 8 feet long, but for 8 bucks it can't be beat."
1,4,I just play at home with friends. It works well so far on all my ukuleles.  However every time you touch your instrument it's going to transmit that sound into your amp so it's nothing I'd be using on stage if I didn't have to.  Still it seems to be a good value but truth be told I haven't had it long so it could crap out on the longevity issue. Time will tell.
0,3,"It arrived on time, I have an Epiphone Hummingbird acoustic guitar, so I needed a pickup for do some recording,it works well but It's not very loud. This thing should sound louder, next time, I'll buy a Duncan pickup."
1,5,"I recently purchased a Vox Mini3 G2 modeling amp to go with my new Mainland Tenor (acoustic/electric) ukulele. It was my first electric instrument and I immediately fell in love with the combination uke/amp.A little time went by and I began wishing I could plug my 5 other non-electric ukuleles and 3 guitars into my amp.  I see DIY pickup sets are pretty inexpensive, but I didn't really want the expense (times eight) or the hassle of drilling holes and installing them on all those instruments.Then I stumbled on this Cherub pickup.  For about the cost of lunch at McDonalds it seemed I might &#34;electrify&#34; on the fly whatever instrument I cared to . . . pickup.  So I bought it.Bottom line is that it works very well for my needs.  And although I don't have a very critical ear, I (think) I can hear a slight quality/clarity difference between the built-in pickup on my Mainland uke vs clipping this onto my other instruments, but that's not a surprise and such a small difference that I don't much care. So far I've been clipping it into the sound holes, but I might try it on the headstock as others have recommended.If you're a Rock-God don't even consider this (why would you anyway?). But if you're a mere mortal just having some fun with your instruments and would like an inexpensive option to plug one in once in a while, this Cherub is for you."
0,3,"For the price you will expect what sound you'll get, I haven't tried other expensive ones, but I have a Yamaha NTX700 with built in pickups (Pro guitar) and the price reflects the quality.Also the WCP-60G has no guide or manual where to attache it to get the best soundIt is not that expensive, you can buy it if you just want the sound of the guitar to be recorded"
0,2,This is more of a toy than a good pickup. It functions but doesn't sound great. What did I want for this price anyway?
1,5,"I put this in the soundhole of a concert ukulele and angled it toward the &#34;G&#34; string and it sounds great. What a buy for the price. You may have to experiment with position and for ukes some have found the headstock to be the best spot. Whatever spot you find is best for you, it's worth it, I'm going to try it on my reso-uke next."
1,5,"Well This work well with my Uke, and there is a review that pretty much sum it up! Put it on the headstock!"
1,5,"only  thing is you need to loosen some strings to get it into place, but  worked great for what I wanted to screw around with it,"
0,2,"First we have to realize this is not a $200 pickup or even a $50 pickup.  It's less than ten bucks.It has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar.  As such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole.  It also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole, as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.It is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices.  Unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4"" to 1/4"" coupler (to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord).  You will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.It is a passive pickup, so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device. If you don't have a preamp system, this will do you no good.So because of the limitations I rate it as above.  For what it does though-- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments, it does okay.  I believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money, including adhesive-disk mikes.  I would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from.  But this is a slightly different concept (removable) that for the price is worth checking in to."
1,5,This is a cool gadget.  I love experimenting with adjusting the power level on various pedals.  It can do some strange things and get unique sounds.
1,5,"I purchased this to replace my other adapter that didn't work. Whereas, this does the job. I'm happy I purchased this and didn't have to invest in purchasing 9V batteries every time I wanted to play guitar."
1,4,"You know the problem with 9v wall warts is that noise in the signal can be a problem.  I am powering my 9 unit pedal board with this adapter and it works great.  I have used it some at lower voltages, but only on my older analog pedals.  I wouldn't reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage.  The cord is a little wimpy compared to my Boss PSA adapter, but it is acceptable."
1,5,"This power supply is advertised as having the capability to power multiple pedals. That's good to know, but since I plan on using it to power only one pedal, it works fine for me. The variable voltage settings give you some interesting effects. I am very pleased with it and recommend it over other brands."
1,5,"The Danelectrode has a knob that allows you to set how much volts you want to feed your pedals with (3V to 9V), by giving less power to them, you can get some really spooky sounds; great fun, but can also help give you your characteristic sound.  I also like the fact that you connect it vertically on the outlet, this allows to connect any other stuff to the same outlet because it does not take all the space on it, like other adapters do.  The price is great, I'm planning to have several of this."
1,5,The first power source that is fun.  It can take the edge off of a distortion of OD pedal by rolling off the voltage.  I have yet to use it with a fuzz but I hear it sound sick.
1,4,"I like the Dan Electrode but I noticed dropping the voltage on some of my pedals really changes the effect (turned my Heavy Metal into a sick fuzz and my LavaBox  into a primitive distortion), and on others dropping voltage can mean a slight loss of sustain(Onerr Overdrive) or volume(FrenchToast) and thats it. It's still a good 9volt power supply but the voltage drop feature doesn't always 'wow' you."
1,5,"This may have been the best money I've ever spent for a guitar accessory. I can dial the pressure to exactly what I need for any spot on the neck. It has a smooth action, no ""kerchunk"" noise. My guitar stays in tune when capo-ed. I love it!"
1,5,"Good quality. Adjustable and does not get in the way, Great improvement over spring capos. Not much more to say but need five more words to post"
1,5,"I've bought 3 capos in the last couple months searching for the perfect fit. Well, the hunt is over. Amazing tone, perfect tuning. I'm completely amazed with this capo........"
1,4,Well made Capo. Works as designed on my acoustic. Easy to usel and it is nice that you can adjust the pressure on the strings. Just wish it had a spring so It could stay attached to the head of the guitar when not in use. I am always setting it down and forgetting where I left it.
1,4,I started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neck.I found that I needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the G7th. Both are very good. I did notice that if I had a wider neck (I think i am 42.5 mm at the nut on my two Takamines) the may be a bit short. They work and are cool looking. I have aa adjustable Planet Waves that also works great. Cheaper ones also work
1,5,"Well made, proven over decades. Switched from NS capo to improve tone with a one piece mahogany neck. Not sure there is a huge difference but there does seem to be an improvement. Requires less adjustment. Square pad allows placement right next to the fret. Easy to adjust with a bit of practice.I enjoy using quality machined parts, so this is a pleasure, plus it is built to last."
1,5,"So I heard these were good, and ordered one to try. I was really amazed at the quality and awesome feel of it locking down.A must have."
1,5,"I've used Shubb for years.  I strayed briefly on a Fender Smart capo.  You can read my review on that item.  I really liked it at first and in my review I said I was converted from Shubb.  Im back to Shubb.  The Fender is plastic and it works fine on my electrics but not as well as on my acoustic.  The Shubb works great on both. If you just buy a Shubb to begin with, you wont ever have to waste money on trying out different capos.  It will not clamp on to your headstock, so if you like having a capo sticking out of your guitar when you're not using it, then this isn't it."
0,3,"I like this capo because you can adjust the pressure, but I've had it pop of easily twice already. Have others I trust more."
1,5,"If you enjoy playing Guitars, then I think you will love this Shubb S1 Acoustic Guitar Deluxe Capo. It something NICE to have around your house and work great.  Thanks to all."
1,5,"I've tried them all, and I like the Shubb the best. Easy to use, very tight and doesn't get in the way."
1,5,"Simple. Effective.  Just what I wanted.  Seems a tad flimsy, but, time will tell.  Tuning couldn't be easier.  Neat product."
1,5,"Simple and easy to use, easy to carry around.Love it, the display is cool, and can't ask anything more."
0,3,It's not that great. You go through batteries like crazy and it doesn't work at all for bass. It's fine for guitar or banjo
1,5,"Easy and quite simple to use, this tuner is accurate and none intrusive, so you can leave it on your instrument for a quick re-tune on the go."
1,4,i ordered a couple from my guitar seller...enjoyed..saw these and tried again...the box for tuner was a little smushed...but well packaged and arrived on time...will order again if needed..enjoy
1,5,"Works amazingly well, is very precise, and easy to handle. I have seen other devices that would get confused about frequencies and jump back and forth between different notes. Not so this one. It is a great, reliable tuner."
1,5,"works great,great little tuner,i would recomend this for experienced player and a beginner. i was skeptical when a friend rcommended it, but im pretty impressed."
1,4,"This is a handy little piece, and for the money a great deal.  I have one of these for each of my guitars and they're as accurate as anything else I've used."
1,5,"Well, to date, these Snark tuners have got to be one of the best tuners I've ever run across.I highly recommend them, especially the ones with the built-in vibration sensor."
0,3,"I ordered this primarily for my 5 string Ovation Bass.  First, there is very little room on the head stock for it to clamp without hitting strings.  My Ovation has a beveled end to the head stock but I was finally got it on the bottom between the D & G string tuners.  It does not respond well to an open B, but octaves are fine and as long as I have confidence in my intonation it is no problem.  I tested it against some of my more sensitive tuners and found it to be spot on.  When I tried it on my Ibanz solid body 5-string I found it to be even less likely to &#34;read&#34; quickly or at all. Also worked great on my 6 strings."
1,5,"I used this tuner as I transitioned from playing Rocksmith to playing in the real world. My amp had a built in tuner, but it seemed to give inconsistent readings. With this tuner, it doesn't matter if it is electric or acoustic, it gives a very very accurate reading. My luthier tunes by ear and when we tested against it, they were only off by 2 units in any given direction. Very happy and pleased with this one."
1,5,i bought three of these items after i first tried ine from a friend. and i am convince that the tuning is consistent and very handy.. a must for guitarists!
1,5,Does what it was intended to do. Completely satisfied with this purchase. Seems to work just fine for my needs.
0,3,"The one that shipped was the cheaper, shiny plastic one.  In my experience this model is inferior.  Also the rubber lining inside the clip was unattached - probably the glue didn't hold?  I like Snarks and think they are some of the best clip-on tuners.  Just not a fan of the cheap, shiny plastic versions.  I'll try returning it and getting the SN-8."
1,5,"Got this to tune my guitar without relying on Rocksmith on my PS3, and to double check against it. I have a pretty crappy ear, so I rely on it to tune correctly. Responds fast, display is INCREDIBLE! I wish my car dash looked like this thing. Fits easily on the headstock of the guitar, in front or behind. Tunes by sensing the vibration of the instrument, not using a microphone, so you can tune even if it is noisy. And any pedals, effects, amps, etc in the setup do not affect the tone, you are tuning the actual resonance of the string. Even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well. Forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too. For the price, I would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one."
1,5,"I bought this because I bought a used Martin D15M that didn't have a tuner built in, and it clips right on the neck and is easy to turn on. The cool led readout instantly tells you which string, and gives you the ""green"" when the string is in tune. This is a great little tuner and I recommend it."
1,5,"Really, they are. I really don't have anything more to say about it. I've played for 13 years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever. Affordable, accurate, and they don't fall off your knee all the time lol!"
1,4,"The tuner I choose is very easy to use, simple and small. Good for people who don't have time and patience for to conect cables to tune the instrument. I recomend it."
1,4,"Great tuner for the price.Makes tunning easy and fast.The grips come off the neck on my acoustic,but works better on my electric."
1,5,It is really helpful to a person like me that knows jack squat about music. I really do recommend it is tiny so it is not all big and in your face and you can easily take it off if it does bother you.
1,5,Great tuner just bought 8 of them for X-Mas presents. Very easy to use  clip on and go. The price was great. fits in your case. battery life is good. very versatel. Tune my Mandolin and Banjo with it.and they look really cool
1,5,"This little Snark is easy to carry around and works great.  I have used several different styles and brands, this is a must have for musicians."
1,4,"I was not sure about this at first. Seemed too cheap to work. But I was happily surprised. It works welll.Not perfect, but not expensive.Get one."
1,5,"Great little tooland very handy, a bargain and a good buy Does not mar my guitar and is easy to see,Thanks"
1,5,#NAME?
1,5,Snark tuners are the best.  A few months ago I bought a different brand tuner and it doesn't pick up all strings.  I bought this one and it works great.  No problems.
0,3,"It's a great little tuner, great accuracy, but unfortunately, they are a bit on the delicate side. The first one started working about a week after i bought it. Just broke down. The second one i purchased had a break when it arrived. After piecing the two of them together, i have a nice stable tuner. But beware...these are manufactured on the cheap."
1,5,"Snark tuners are great. Since I've bought Snark tuners, they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way. I've had some for years that I still use today without ever changing batteries or anything. They are great and last forever. This one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine-tune your instrument. It have a vibration and mic sensor, so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played. Really nice piece of equipment for a small price."
1,5,It's a pretty cool little gizmo. The clip on feature is really helpful too; makes me wonder what I did before I had one.
1,5,"I have several of these for my guitar, fiddle, and mandolin.  It works well for all of them and is inexpensive."
1,5,"I tried one of these on my violin at a Guitar Center where it's costs more than Amazon.I think the Amazon price is the best you'll find.It works as well as expensive tuners. In addition to tuning up the strings, I use it to practice scales on the violin and check my intonation.Be advised though, that it only registers natural notes and sharps. It does not show a readout of flat notes, instead it shows the &#34;equivalent&#34; note. But as violin players know, a B flat is NOT the same as an A#.But it doesn't just read the letter of the note your on. The graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it.For ten bucks, you can't go wrong."
1,4,"This will b my 2nd one of these so to me it's worth it. The 1st one I loaned to a friend and never got back so for $10 I just got another. I think their pretty accurate. I normally tune by ear but if there's a few of us playing then sometimes someone needs one, and I always use it putting on new strings myself. As far as battery life goes you can get them right on Amazon. They are cheap you can get a package of 6, each one lasting over a year or if you prefer you can go over to Walmart and get them in the jewelery section."
1,4,"I'm pretty impressed with it.  I've only used plug-in types of tuners prior, and this was a nice surprise.  I ran this through my ukulele, electric guitars as well as an electric bass.  I was blown away how it could tune my bass.  It works quickly, and it seems pretty accurate compared to my Petersen.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Took one star off for visibility.  Certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily."
1,5,"My eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin. It seems to be accurate, and he is now capable of tuning his violin by himself."
1,5,"I used other clamp type tuners and this one fit the bill perfectly.  I bought my dad one, too.  he loves it too!!!"
1,5,Works well even with a room full of noise....................plus it's easy to see. These are the best buy for my money when it comes to tuning a Guitar or Uke.
1,5,"I used this to tune a coconut thumb piano. If it can tune that, it should handle your guitar or bass FINE. Was really impressed to see it in action. NOT THE SMOOTHEST operation in the world but it's gig-bag small and accurate."
1,4,"Works great and does a good job, a must have type tool for the price get one !!! Light takes up little space and easy to use ."
1,5,Clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar. Pluck a string and it will indicate what it is. Turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done. Takes 10 minutes to tune the guitar. Mine is electric. Works plugged in or unplugged.
1,5,"Got this tuner for my new bass.  clipped it onto the headstock, was able to tune without plugging it into the amp. clear bright display.  Might have to pickup a couple more of these for my other guitars"
0,2,"I bought this to use on my Fender P-bass. It is not reliable for me, sometimes it works and sometimes it can't find the low note correctly. I'm still using my Roland stomp box tuner. Glad this was inexpensive, it was not worth the hassle to return, i gave it away."
1,4,"Snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find. And they tune with amazing accuracy. If this model had a microphone to detect sound it might have been even better, but there's already another model for that. In one way it's better because sometimes the vibration and sound sensor works together to pickup other sounds while you're tuning, so this tuner is a pretty good choice."
1,4,"I LOVE snark tuners, this not being the first one I bought, nor the last. I loved the fact that I didn't have to press all the buttons like the other ones. Just get it relatively in tune by ear, then this thing will help you with the rest. My only problem is with the little rubber plastic on the grip. It has already pulled up and I only put it on and off my guitar maybe 3 times so far. I mean, I've had it for less then a month now and that is pretty bad. I'm just going to glue it back but it seems like it should have been better in that aspect. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a black snark tuner for their axe."
1,4,"I have played guitar/bass for quite some time and have used numerous tuners ranging those those big Korg strobe tuners to my latest Sabine STX-1100. I liked the big Boss TU-1000 but that is overkill unless in certain situations.I was at a big jam in a nightclub around Christmas and saw a bunch of guys using clamp on tuners of varying brands and thought I would try one. I looked at the Amazon offerings and after reading reviews settled on this one over the SN1 or SN2.This is too easy and my guitar has never stayed in tune like this before. It requires no input from your guitar so can be used any time. The only thing I don't like about it is it doesn't really like the E string of my bass. I don't think it picks up those long wavelengths so well. I will try the SN8 shortly and give this one to a friend.I do recommend this for guitarists because you will always be in tune no matter the tuning. If you leave it on while soloing you can see what notes you are playing. I am my own guitar tech, as well as for a friend, and I can set the intonation perfectly with this thing.Get a Snark and you will be happy.Edit - I don't like to use this with my PRS as the headstock has very little room to clip this to. The only place to clip is the very end and you are fighting tuning keys for space at that point. If you can get it there comfortably it works but nothing like with a Fender or Gibson; both which have plenty of space on the headstock."
1,4,"I had bought an SN2 and love it but I found it had a little trouble recognizing the low E on my bass. This handles bass tuning much better. The lit display is great for tuning on stage, and because it works on vibration you don't need to worry about muting when you are tuning.I also find it very accurate. I would have given it 5 stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks. This is probably the seller and not the manufacturer."
1,4,"I've had a few of these things, not all the same model. This one was hard to read. I changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit. Overall I like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal."
0,3,"This tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly. Clamp it on, press the power switch, and then  pluck a string. It will tell you if you are hitting the right note and if it is in tune.I only gave this 3 stars because the battery meter only indicated 1/2 charge out of the box. It still had the plastic barrier that had to be removed to connect the battery.  Shouldn't it have a full battery since it is brand new? Not enough of a hassle to send it back, but worth mentioning.Had the battery not been an issue, I would have rated this 5 stars."
1,5,"This is one of the best, simple to use, guitar tuners I've used -- and I've used a lot of them.  The bonus is that it's also one of the least expensive that I've seen.  You won't be disappointed."
1,4,"Any guitarist knows how one of these works.  Clamp it on the head, turn it on, and tune.  I've tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass.  My only real complaint is that it often takes 3-4 seconds to register the note it's getting.  It occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well.  The low E on my bass will occasionally register as a B (3rd harmonic) for example.  In general, the dullest means of plucking the string (finger instead of pick) will give the quickest and most glitch-free pitch.  All in all, it's a handy little tool to have in the gig bag."
1,4,"Not quite as loaded as the red All Instrument Snark, but it gets the job done. Is very sensitive to vibration."
1,5,"I've been using aKorg TM-40 Large Display Digital Tuner and Metronomefor a long time with my guitar. While adequate, I wanted the Snark because it was made specifically for guitar and the clip-on feature would counter my laziness in finding the tuner.The snark is great, and the price is amazing. The Snark, unlike the Korg, tunes by vibration.. so if it isn't attached the the guitar, it won't work. I feel that the vibration tuning is more accurate and efficient. With the Korg, the dial would spin all over the place and I would just mentally estimate where the right tone would be. The Snark is much more decisive and faster so it eliminates all the guesswork out of tuning. You will know exactly how sharp or flat the guitar is or if you want to try alternative tunings like drop-D it is so much simpler than with the Korg.No metronome but that's what I'm keeping the Korg for. I also wish that this specific came in another color other than black. There are Snarks in other colors but this model is specifically for guitars.Overall, extremely happy with this purchase."
1,5,"Awesome for $10. Accurate with TV on in the background. This thing is just sweet, I just love it. Easy no-brainer."
1,5,"It's just about dead-on with my Korg, which is extremely accurate. I had never seen a tuner that you can just clip onto the neck like this, and it is hugely convenient to have it sitting right there as you play. It's soft enough with the clip, that it is safe to have on a high end guitar without worrying about it scratching or hurting anything. It shuts itself off when you forget to do that -- which happens a lot. Good little tuner at a steal of a price. I like it."
1,4,"I play guitar, bass and violin.....and more. I have used many clip on tuners that are two and three times the cost and are just okay. In fact that may be saying too much.  I was really surprised at the Snark SN-5 tuner.  I found it very accurate.  I compared it to my Boss TU-2 tuner plugged in to the guitar and it was just as accurate and maybe a bit tighter.  I decided to adjust my guitar intonation with the Snark (no one would ever do this...this was a test) and it was very close to my stroboscope.  I plan on buying the higher quality Snark tuner that supposed to be even tighter.  Very impressed with this. If I can take my tuner pedal out of the loop and off my board, I will be happy.  These are cheap enough to buy one for each guitar so I don't have to move it around as I change guitars during performances."
0,1,"I am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ...First the positives:- Looks great- nice, easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice priceNow the significant disappointment:- inaccurateThe settings were on A-440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp ... I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products, they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner (it has its place I guess, but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO) ...I haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ...Bottom line, no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard A-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ..."
1,5,"I have several Snarks. This one is the most basic. All are fast and accurate. I have many young guitar students and the Snark is the first tuner they have no trouble using. I also have purchased several red, blue and the new Super Tight tuner. The Super Tight is slightly faster, brighter and more accurate, but the speed, brightness and accuracy of all Snarks are very, very good. I own many tuners, and clip ons of many other brands. The Snark is by far my favorite. There is no close second."
1,5,"I've been playing guitar for over 25 years and been through many different style of tuners. This is by far the best I've ever had. Not only is it accurate and easy to use, but it's so convenient! Simply clip it to the head of the guitar, press the only button on the unit and start tuning. Also, unlike other tuners I've used, this tuner does a great job of filtering/ignoring ambient noise in the room. I can actually tune my guitar while having a conversation, even with the TV on in the room!Pro's:- Vibrant , easy to read display- No need for cords, chargers even when used on electric guitars/bass.- Simple one button activation- Lightweight - I leave it on my classical guitar all the time, especially after restringing.- Auto Shutoff (also can manually shut it off, just press the one button a second time)- Works for Guitar and Bass (both acoustic and electric) and violin - Also works on my Ukulele!Con's:Wish I had this 20 years ago!Bottom Line:This is a no-brainer. The price, quality and easy of use make it a must have for any guitarist."
1,4,I really and suprisingly like this little gadget. It works great on my electric and acoustic guitars and really is quite accurate.
1,5,"This is a very accurate tuner. I have used it on mandolins, guitars, violins and violas, and double bass. They are a little hard on batteries, but not overly so.Highly recommend!"
1,4,"I love the small size of this tuner, and it clips on to the guitar headstock firmly. The tuner picks up vibrations, so it doesn't require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar. There's just one button, so it's idiot-proof. However, the button can get pushed to easily, so sometimes the tuner is on in my guitar case, running the battery out too soon.Speaking of battery, the smallness of the tuner necessitates a small battery, but I hate that they used the CR2032 battery. It just doesn't last long, and in Brazil, it's really hard to find this battery at all."
0,1,"I own the SN-8, which btw, is the best tuner I've ever used. I bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin. So I wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin. I was also intrigued by the &#34;tighter&#34; tuning aspect of the bars on this. Let me tell you, if it worked, the bars may have been a cool feature, but when you are fine-tuning an A string and it tells you you are on E (when you know you are on A bc the other tuners all say A, and it matches the piano), then there is a problem. I could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing, so it looks like it's just defective. The one I received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great SN-8...I am disappointed in this thing. I must have just received a dud (I hope, since these usually get good reviews), but I will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly. On the flip side, I will be getting another SN-8 in it's place, since I know those are great tuners & I love the one I already have."
1,5,They still work years later.  I've had to change a few batteries but they last a long time.  Fabulous tuner.  Even works on a stand-up bass.  Just clip it onto the bridge.  Excellent product.
1,5,"I love my Snark SN5 tuner.  It works smoothly without any issues, and allows me to tune my guitar swiftly and accurately.  All you need to do is clamp the tuner to the headstock, and it is ready to go.  The SN5 is smaller than I expected, but the multicolored meter is easily readable, and the meter can adjusted so that it can be seen clearly from any position.Using the color coded meter, you can tell whether a string is flat or sharp, and adjust the string tension accordingly.  With a little practice, tuning becomes a quick and easy process.  The unit is powered by a CR 2032 battery, which generally has a long life.Although the clamp has rubber pads, apparently the finishes of certain guitars could still be prone to damage.  The instructions states that the Snark is not recommended for guitars with the following finishes, polyurethane, French polish, and nitrocellulose lacquer.  Those with Gibson, Gretch, or Taylor guitars may want pay particular attention to this warning.  I have had no problems using this tuner on Kramer, Ibanez, Charvel, Epiphone, and ESP guitars.  The tuner also works for bass guitars and violins.  I do not have either of those instruments, but I imagine the tuner would work much the same.As there are a number of guitar tuners that attach to the headstock, it took me a little while to decide on the SN5.  Even after eliminating tuners by D'Addario and Planet Waves, selecting the SN5 wasn't that simple, as Snark makes a number of similar tuners.  I am completely satisfied with the SN5, and believe that it fully deserves a 5 star rating.  It is also the least expensive, of the tuners I was considering buying.  If the finish of your guitar isn't an issue, you may find the Snark to be very helpful."
1,5,"I love this tuner... I have other similar models, and they are all great.don't hesitate to get one.These are three times as high at guitar center.  how ridiculous.ok.. this may sound silly, but just to let you know you can do it.if you hold a stick or something similar touching your throat, and clip this tuner to it, you can tune your voice with it.even holding your thumb against your voicebox and clip this on your finger will do it.cracks me up, but fun to play with"
1,5,"The Snark SN-5 Tuner for Guitar, Bass and Violin gives me spot on tuning. I especially love being able to tune with a silent tuner. When playing music with other musicians who are also tuning or warming up I don't have to be concerned with hearing myself pluck the strings of my guitar or violin while comparing the sound to a pitch pipe or keyboard. This tuner works by picking up the vibrations of my instrument.I decided to buy this tuner after another musician lent me his extra one during a jam session. I was really impressed with it and had to get one for myself ASAP!"
1,4,"works as it shoukd, better instructions could come with it with a larger size text. also how to open to replace battery as well as the specs on the battery are lacking."
1,5,"I've had two of these tuners, and they do a fine job as far as I can tell.  I lost one, and had to buy another one.  I also bought a much more expensive tuner, and I cannot see that it does a better job than this one.  I bought my first tuner like this one about 3 years ago, and the rubber pads kept falling off, but I have not had that problem with my new one."
1,5,"Before I bought this I had to use a tuner on my laptop. Now I just clip it on to my ukulele and tune it in a matter of seconds. I also really like how it senses the vibrations from the instrument. It doesn't matter how much noise there is in the room, it still tunes perfectly every time."
1,5,"I own several tuners, and two Snark-2 tuners, which are great (except they're not low profile like theKorg Pitchclip Chromatic Clip On Guitar Tuner - Korg PC-1--please see my review of that tuner).So, since I needed another tuner for my ukulele, I ordered this time a Snark-6.  This one says, specifically, for a ukulele.  I wanted to try it compared to the Snark-2Snark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic TunerThe Snark-6 and Snark-2 are identical, except for color.  The Uke tuner here is gloss black, and the Snark-2 is matte red.  Otherwise, the size of the dial/face, the clip itself is precisely the same.  So, there's nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2.  The tuning is chromatic, so it's good for any specific instrument (mandolin, guitar, uke, banjo, etc.).So, choose whichever color you prefer, and go for it.  Sweet tuner.  Superb graphics on the dial, colorful accurate, and inexpensive (but not ""cheap"" build, like the Korg).  Highly recommended tuner."
1,5,I love this tuner. I feel its more accurate that the old one I have that was given to me. I will always buy Snark tuners. They are very sensitive so I feel that my instrument is in truer tune.
1,5,"I bought this to use primarily with my newly bought Ukulele, but it also works perfectly to tune my old acoustic guitar too. The display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate. I wish I'd bought one of these years ago instead of tuning my stringed instruments manually ""by ear"". Until now I'd assumed I tuned my instruments perfectly well, but this unit proved me wrong - both my Uke and guitar sound better after being fine tuned with this.This little gadget saves time, improves tuning accuracy and is absolutely perfect for the job it is designed for.It comes supplied with a CR2032 battery and a basic protective bag to keep it in when not in use."
1,5,I have use this tuner for quite a few years . its easy to use-- clip it on and go.. I just bought 8 of them for christmas presents for all my friends that play guitar or Mandolin. The price was good see ya
1,5,Snark tuners are great! They are very accurate and are very inexpensive. I have now four of them so I can keep one in each guitar case and one for the uke!
1,5,"I use this for my uke, my 12 string acoustic, a parlor guitar, and my trusty Taylor. Easy to use, very accurate, highly recommended."
0,2,"There is almost no difference between this and the Snark SN-1, and by that I mean the design flaws. You have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading, and they eat batteries like crazy. The Snark SN-8 is far superior."
1,5,Extremely easy to use. tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly! Have used it several times and first battery still has juice.
1,5,"This is accurate and can be used for many different purposes, It is durable and can be used while playing."
1,5,Works like it's supposed to.  Although I should have just got the universal instrument tuner.  This one only tunes in the uke keys.
1,5,"Been using the snark tuners for while now... Functions perfectly.. Only problem I have is it is small enough that I have trouble finding it sometime... So, I have just started leaving it on the instrument and buying others to do the same..."
1,5,"Anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that I am not fond of the Snark displays.  I prefer the ""needle"" type because it's symmetric above and below center while the Snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp.  However, that's me and YMMV, as they say on the Internet.Don't ask, then, why I got a SN-6.  I don't smoke, drink, or womanize, the unit is cheap, the money's got to go somewhere, and I like to play with accessories.I am fond of saying that it doesn't matter which type of tuner you use because they've pretty much become a commodity.  They all tune well with the same accuracy, so it comes down to looks and price.Well, that's not *quite* true.  Some models suffer fits in certain situations.  The rapid fall of the old Intellitouch was, in my mind, not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low E string on a Martin dreadnought.  A web search will reveal countless workarounds.  I (and the rest of the world, apparently) buy a tuner to tune, not work around.Lately, I've become enamored of theKala KA-UBASSFS Solid Mahogany U-BASS - Fretted.  If you want a tuning challenge, the low bass E string is it.  The SN-6 hardly hiccups.  Other tuners seem to do ""okay"" but require a little coaxing.  Not the SN-6! That's 5 stars in my book!"
1,4,"This little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off.  It works without it, but things things like that putt me nuts."
1,5,"The Snark is great. I have 2 for my 4 ukuleles (so I can always find one),and a 3rd for my guitar. It's not just a UKE tuner. LOVE THEM! And, gavemy grandson a shock-blue one to go with his American Flag painted uke."
1,5,Works great and easy to use.  It also seems to be very accurate.  Definitely worth the money!! (Should also work for any stringed instrument)
1,5,"I'VE ALWAYS TUNED MY UKULELES BY EAR.  NO PROBLEM.  BUT I RECENTLY BOUGHT A SOPRANO UKULELE FOR MY GREAT NIECE AND KNEW I  COULDN'T ALWAYS BE THERE TO TUNE IT FOR HER.  I WAS LEARY ABOUT THE USE OF THE SNARK DESPITE READING MANY FAVORABLE REVIEWS PRAISING IT.  BUT I'M NOW A CONVINCED SNARK USER..  SO SIMPLE.  SO EASY TO USE.  SO ACCURATE.  SO LIGHT.  PLUCK A STRING AND TUNE IT TO THE DIAL, AND EUREKA .-  SUCCESS.  BUY ONE - YOU'LL LIKE IT."
1,5,"This is my third Snark tuner, I keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear. I use it on all my stringed instruments, (Haven't tried it on a base) This tuner is easy to attach and read, and the price is great, I have spent 60 bucks on tuners that do not function as well."
0,3,"I ordered the Hola! and the Snark SN-6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church.  I've spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to &#34;settle in&#34;.  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent.  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one.  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone.The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store.  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark.  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need.  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther.  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read.  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are.  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!.Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function.  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off).  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician.  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano.  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes.  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments.The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction.  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark.  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient.  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar.The Snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable, cardboard box.  I have no problem with it, but the Hola! stores better.  I don't really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a &#34;ukulele&#34; setting.  It's a chromatic tuner.  It very well may be sized differently from their other models to fit better on ukuleles.  Other than that, I'm not quite sure what makes it specifically a &#34;Ukulele tuner&#34;."
1,5,"If you have a ukulele you know (or may not know) that it needs constant tuning especially with new strings. This little gadget does the trick. I was pleased to see that it is a no brainer to use and since it clips to the head it is there when you need it between songs.You will not go wrong with this purchase and I am sure you will love it better than trying the &#34;my dog has fleas&#34; tuning method.Oh yea, it does not just limit you to the basic notes for the uke but will tell you sharp and flat notes too!Now put that order in!"
1,5,"These are great little tuners!  You can leave them clamped on your instrument and make spot adjustments on the fly, which is especially helpful when you're breaking in strings or any time.  I've played guitar a long time and ukulele is fairly recent, and it seems that maybe their shorter strings are somehow more susceptible to influences like temperature fluctuation or just vigorous strumming.SO, these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts."
1,5,"I bought one for my tenor and a different brand for my soprano Ukulele,,  I found I like the snark better for the dollar more in cost..  the other has multi use ( bass, chord, ukulele ) and seemed cheap,  I liked the snark so much I bought this one for my concert ukulele,,  you might ask, Huh  why one for each ukulele,  if you play,, then the answer is simple, for 10 bucks I do not have to hassle swapping tuners out,, and can just grab my ukulele and go."
1,5,It's easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician. Good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly.
0,3,"I personally own two of these Snarks and I've seen several others among my friends.  They're great, easy-to-read and easy-to-use tuners that are surprisingly cheap.However, half of the Snarks I've come into contact with have broken within a few weeks.  One of mine broke after about 2 weeks of very light usage.  The screen is SUPER faint.  It's still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting.  This also happened to two of my friend's Snarks.My other Snark is still going strong.  I'd still recommend them for non-critical applications just for the price and ease of use.  However, these definitely aren't reliable gig-worthy tuners.  They're just so cheap it's easy to buy multiple Snarks and cover all of your guitars."
1,5,This little gem is worth it's weight in gold!  So easy to tune with it.  We have used it seemingly zillions of times and the battery is still going strong.  Automatic  shut-off helps too.
1,5,I use this adapter to connect my electric guitar and my acoustic guitar to my computer and IT WORKS PERFECTLY!!! Very minimal buzz... LLLOVE IT!!!
1,5,"If you are like me, my research for a guitar connection to my iPad left me with choosing between the iRiffport and the Jam.  I recently purchased, and then returned, the iRiffport.  I am very pleased that I purchased the Apogee Jam as a replacement.  Here are the reasons why:1) The connector on the iRiffport (the one that goes into the iPad) is not a strong connection at all; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time.  I have a stand to put my iPad on when jamming such that the iPad is in landscape mode, so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way.  With the Apogee Jam, the connector is just like the iPad's connector, except it ALSO has the ""prongs"" that come out of it, securing the connector into the iPad.  To remove the connector from the iPad, you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the ""prongs"" go in so it can be removed...very, very secure.  I use the ""Gumdrop"" case on my iPad, which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used.  This flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used.  IMPORTANT:  if you have such an iPad case, like me, I certainly feel that the Jam will provide a much more secure connection to your iPad over the iRiffport.  In fact, the structure of the iRiffport connector was so large, that I felt that it did not fit well through my case.  On the other hand, the Jam's connector is the same small size as the iPad's original connector.  This is also something to consider if you intend to use your iPad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the iPad.2) Probably the largest reason I prefer the Jam over the iRiffport:  you can hear sound directly from the iPad.  With the iRiffport, you MUST use headphones or attach external speakers.  I tried headphones with the iRiffport and playing the guitar was very awkward.  Nonetheless, with the Jam, I could attach headphones or external speakers to the iPad if I chose to do so.  I wanted something that could make my iPad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house, without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers.  With the Jam, I have this.3) The Jam has a gain meter (i.e., an LED) and a gain control.  The iRiffport does not.  When not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio, the LED lets you know if you are connected to the iPad, but not to any software (blue light), or if you are connected to the iPad AND to a software application (green light).  There are no batteries needed for the Jam or the iRiffport.4) I personally like that I can use my own guitar cord with the Jam.  If the cord breaks, I simply replace the cord, not my iPad connection device.  The iRiffport uses its own cord, and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my ""normal"" guitar cable I used with the Jam.5)  Although a fairly minor point, it is nice to know that the Jam is advertised by Apple (look at their website and their Garageband video).  And, since I have Garageband on my iPad, I was pleased to see that the advertising material on the Jam states specifically that it works with Garageband.So far, I'm very pleased with the Jam."
0,1,"Can't believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector.  I have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector.  This is now a boat anchor.  To buy a 3 meter cable from them, they charge $40 for the cable, $15 to ship it and then tax.  The extortion here is almost Monster cable like.  These folks should be embarassed."
0,2,"This gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an iPad or iPhone or a computer, but the particular one I received has a defective input socket for a 1/4 inch audio plug.  It doesn't snap in place.  Just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out.  That makes it fairly useless.  I may have simply gotten a defective one."
1,5,"My only reluctance about getting this was I thought the price was a little higher than it needed to be but I unboxed and connected this little dealie up and it does exactly what it says it does: it gets down my guitar tracks in iPad and sounds terrific so the $99.00 price tag isn't such a big deal.  NO learning curve, simply connect the included cable from the Jam to your 30-pin iPad dock, plug in your guitar, pull up GarageBand, select an amp, click on the icon in GarageBand that shows the guitar cable end, then select ""On"" for monitoring, hit record and start jamming, man - that is ALL there is to it.  I've not been one to record on computers for a long time, preferring instead to use such things as Fostex 8-track recorders, Behringer mixers, Digitech effect pedals, etc. but this is going to change all that.  Awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use.  UPDATE:  I mentioned a Behringer mixer above (Xenyx 802). I discovered that this Apogee Jam will take the signal routed (standard guitar type 1/4 in. cable) from the Behringer's control out (L- mono) thus allowing you to use the mixer for multiple inputs, both microphone & guitar. The sound quality doing this is excellent, I've recorded a guitar and vocal track and it worked beautifully.  You just have to be careful not to overdrive the Jam. Consequently, my opinion of the Apogee Jam is even higher than it was when I wrote my initial review in March.  I may not even need that Focusrite box now!"
1,5,"I really can't say enough positive things about the Apogee JAM.  Not even 3 years ago, I would have considered recording into an iPad or iPhone to be a &#34;novelty&#34;, and the interface products that most people use to hook up your guitar as &#34;gimmicks&#34; or &#34;toys&#34;.  Now, as of 2013/14, we have so many quality modeling programs, recording DAW's, and AudioBus to connect them to one another.  Whether you're a budding professional, or just a hobbyist aiming to record your own covers, the Apogee JAM (usually around $99.99) deserves a serious look.PROS -Extremely easy to use and widely compatible --&#62; No batteries required.  You get a small plastic converter with an 1/4&#34; input (for guitar cable) on one end and a digital output for 30-pin connector, Lightning, or Mac cables, all of which are included.  Virtually any serious guitar recording app in iOS (GarageBand, Agile AmpKit, AmpliTube, JamUp XT) will recognize and work with the Apogee JAM right out of the box.Crystal clear digital sound --&#62; The sound quality you get through the digital input is markedly better than using the headphone jack as an input.  You'll hear your guitar as it's meant to be heard, and with far less hissing and junk in the background.Considerably less feedback --&#62; This was actually the primary reason I decided to upgrade.  My Positive Grid JamUp Plug wasn't disappointing me in sound quality, but there was so much additional noise that went with it, it would easily cause my modeling amps in Agile AmpKit+ to feed back.  High gain settings (even something basic like a Marshall JCM900) were practically unusable.  Even with clean settings, I had the noise filter turned WAY up, and that still didn't thwart the feedback issues.  The Apogee JAM cured ALL of that instantly.  When I first plugged it in, I wasn't even sure it was on because I expected to hear constant hissing in the background.  What I assumed was a fault of the software was actually due to a poor interface.  The JAM's improvement in avoiding feedback, alone, made it worth its price.No &#34;crosstalk&#34; - When you do multi-track recording with a headphone jack splitter, you get a bleed-over effect referred to as cross-talk.  Basically, you are using the headphone input to monitor and play along with your track, but due to poor circuitry, this also gets fed back into the &#34;armed&#34; track you are recording.  Some people are bothered by this more than others, but it makes quality multi-track recording quite challenging.  I haven't noticed any of that using the Apogee JAM whatsoever, since it is a digital connection.  (You can still monitor your playing using the iPad's headphone jack separately, obviously).Gain control and LED gauge --&#62; Not a feature unique to the JAM, but I love how it's implemented.  When you first plug in the device, the LED light is blue to show that it is hooked up, but not being utilized by software.  Once the input is active in software, the light becomes green.  However, as you play and hit harder notes, the light may change to yellow/orange, or even red.  If it is getting into the red, your input level is too high, and may overdrive the signal.  You adjust this right on the JAM using a roller dial.  I tend to aim for a setting where the light is largely green and starts to touch yellow only in the more aggressive parts.  Works well.CONS -Price point is a little high --&#62; Admittedly, I wasn't thrilled about having to spend $99.99 for what I was already doing with a $20 headphone jack.  That being said, I researched all of the alternatives and repeatedly heard that this was the best.  If I knew it would be as good as it is, the price would have been of little concern.  Also, there aren't really any quality DIGITAL options that are significantly cheaper.Lightweight plastic design --&#62; I actually have no problem with the build quality of the JAM, or that it is made out of plastic.  At the same time, the fact that it is relatively lightweight means that your guitar cable may pull it off of a table.  I also would not advise stepping on it if it happens to fall on the floor.  But they do include two velcro strips to fasten it, and it's a problem you can address with common sense.Highly recommend the Apogee JAM.  It's a mid-level priced device that services everyone from complete amateurs to recording professionals."
0,1,"What was thought to be a DOA model, ended up being a mistake on my behalf. My iPhone 4S, which I have had for about a year now, must've had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine...unless trying to use the JAM.In The Box: Comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps.It comes with the JAM and two cables (USB and IOS). It is bigger than I had imaginedIt's almost the length of an iPhone. Feels nice, and is very light. The cords aren't very long."
1,5,"Wow, does this stick or what! I installed a small pedal on my pedalboard with just a small piece of this &#34;Power Grip mounting tape&#34; on the top and bottom of the pedal (HOF reverb) and one afternoon I stumbled or better said kicked my board by accident hitting the pedal right on and man it didn't budge! Had I known this before I would have installed all my pedals with this Power-Grip wonder! Need sticking power? This tape will definitely fill the requirement."
1,5,"Love this stuff. Think I ordered it twice. Much better than standard industrial strength velcro. Just works, so what else more can I say?"
0,3,"Although it does exactly what it says...it will hold your items together (pedals to pedalboard)...it is significantly thicker than I expected which makes it difficult to use properly without covering the entire board. I purchased one strip and I will use it on my backup board, but I don't plan to purchase any more."
1,5,"This Power-Grip Pedalboard Mounting Tape is VELCRO ON STEROIDS!!!  This product makes your pedals SUPER SECURE.  The tape backing is first rate heavy adhesive and the gripping &#34;teeth&#34; would make The &#34;JAWS&#34; shark envious.Word of advice;  Make sure you have your pedals arranged the exact way that you want them before you start mounting them to the board. Once down you can pretty much count on an ALMOST PERMENT MOUNTING.And a hint;  Some pedals (like Behringer) have a rubber bottom. Remove these rubber &#34;non-skid&#34; plates because they come off too easily.Also; AMAZON sells &#34;couplers&#34;.  These take less room  and cut down on the clutter.As a matter of fact, AMAZON sells EVERY THING YOU NEED to put together a Pro Board."
1,5,"This is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there. It is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined. I would recommend to get a few roles of power-grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the 'industrial' velcros included in most pedal boards and a one-meter roll (around 3 feet) wont last long, especially if you have a combination of both regular size (MXR or Boss) and bigger pedals like a Cry Baby Wah or a VOX Satchurator or Time-Machine Reverb or similar. You probably have a few thousand dollars invested in great pedals, even rare ones, so this would be great for you to keep them well-attached to your board and properly organized. Maybe the tape could be made a bit wider, perhaps 1/2 an inch more would be great. It would actually increase a bit the sticking surface. Still a great product/concept. A must buy!"
1,5,"I love this tape for multiple reasons, one because when it's on, it's on and not going to come off with bumps or gigging hard or what not, but at the same time if you would need to reassemble your board and want to move pedals around, you can take it off. It won't be easy, but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off. I was able to get everything off my older board, and it came off so clean I was actually able to sell it! So this is some good stuff! Be prepared to buy a few rolls though for an entire board of pedals, as it hooks to itself so you'll go through it pretty quickly."
1,5,"When I made a larger pedal board (from plywood) to accommodate a new pedal tuner, I could not pull the power-grip tape from the old board to reuse it! The adhesive is extremely strong, and the unique locking surface is almost as strong. Works great."
0,1,"The velcro itself is insanely amazing. Its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing. If you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men, then by all means, use this stuff. In the end, you just can't make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board. Once together, it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably. I cannot think of a practical application for this velcro."
1,5,What a fantastic product! I believe I have been wishing for this for years!Only one problem. Make sure that you want that pedal there - because once it sticks - you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot.No longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel - they actually stay attached to the pedal board!I have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards - this stuff works and is T-U-F-F!I you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need!I just wish I could get paid for endorsing this product!*********************************Still holding strong - building another board and using this stuff - it's much better than regular velcro - I don't have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit - use this and that annoying issue goes away.
1,5,"I've been using a standard size Pedaltrain for years and was tired of the adhesive on the pedal side of the Velcro strips inevitably coming loose after being moved around a bit. I use it to keep 3 pedals in place: a Line 6 M5, a Seymour Duncan Twin Tube Classic, and a Live Wire A/B Switch. The first two are pretty heavy and bulky. I needed something substantial to keep them in their spots especially during transport in the case, being carried vertically, with other electronics and a bunch of cables on top of them.I decided to try out the Power-Grip and have been extremely impressed. First, I stripped the old Velcro stuff off of the pedals and board and cleaned the surfaces thouroughly. It all came off pretty easily. I then applied one strip of Power-Grip to each of the bottom 2 panels on the Pedaltrain and individual pieces to the bottom of the pedals. I then let everything sit for 24 hours as recommended.After attaching the pedals, I was amazed at how well everything was secured. The pedals are only being held by the one strip on the higher panel, the other strip is just padding under the bottom sides of the pedals to prevent metal-on-metal abrasion. However, you can confidently hold the whole thing vertically and shake it aggressively without anything going anywhere.I also appreciate that you can pull pedals off of the board to move them around (with some effort) and the grip will release without the adhesive budging even a bit.The grip also bonds to itself, unlike Velcro where you're keeping track of male and female tape when replacing it.I would recommend following the manufacturer's instructions and applying this stuff to clean, hard, non-porous surfaces. I've heard that the adhesive doesn't work on rubber, wood, etc. Many pedals have rubber padding / feet on the bottom but I've had no trouble prying that stuff right off before putting the tape on.You will appreciate the stability, security, and convenience this stuff provides. Get a few rolls as a meter doesn't go as far as you'd think."
1,4,I have never played a string instrument... and it looks like I'll be able to get the hang of this very quickly. Only problem is the strings. Sting one ... play's &#34;dead&#34; meaning it will not stay in-tune. Not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem. Have another set of strings [better quality] and will try that set soon.
1,5,"This is a great package for beginners. I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called ""Easy Ukelele"" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.My Review:1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the ""Easy Ukelele"" app I mentioned above.2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.So, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says ""Gangia Brand"" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.5. The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.Overall. This is a great price for the package."
0,3,well I found the lesson very good and worth the money I payed as far as the instrument it self found it to be sub par would of payed a few dollars more if the instrument was better quality but the lesson is great
1,4,"This is such a cute little instrument, my daughter loves it and the sound is good.  The only downside is that it doesn't stay tuned for very long.  We always have to go and re-tune it, which can be frustrating.  But otherwise it seems well made, it looks great and when its tunes, the sound is good.  Its not multi-hundred dollar instrument, but for kids and beginners its a good deal."
1,5,"Please don't listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn't keep tune. They don't know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings. You have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch. Like all instruments, the strings have to stretch, especially with nylons, so be patient. It only took me about half an hour. It clearly states STARTER pack, so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele, especially because of the price. These people just do not know how to read. It has a great sound, but the 'lightweight gig bag' definitely is lightweight. If you want real protection, I would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines. it is a great buy though, considering the price. I highly recommend this product."
1,5,"Love the ukulele,  and the book is okay,, shows cords but the songs are very outdated,,  you tube is your friend when learning the uku...Update : I got a tenor uku for Xmas adn bought a concert uku just because, I love them both more than this little guy although it does travel with me and I just forked out money for a hardshell case so it wont get beat up as much in my suitcase by American Airlines,( just ruined my suitcase)anyhow,  it has been going out of tune for awhile now ( c string fattest one)  and I just figured out my bridge is lifting, there are two rivets holding it down and there is a board inside although not a very thick one,,will be putting a new piece on the inside and some good wood glue under the bridge and let it dry,,,  if the bridge falls apart again, I will be smashing the box and making a Banjo uku with the neck,,if you think you are really going to like playing, go for a concert or tenor,,  if you are liking the size spend a bit of money, this is pretty much the same as my grand daughters 20 dollar ebay ukulele I bought myself 4 years ago and gave to my 3 yo grand daughter because that one too would not stay in tune."
1,5,"My hubby and I decided we wanted to learn to play the uke, so we ordered this set based on decent reviews.  Wonderful.  We learned to play thanks to this kit.  While the instrument itself certainly isn't of high quality, it is more than adequate and has a good sound.  The real jewel in the crown 'tho is the instruction book.  Fab! It is highly informative, easy to follow, and has some good songs in it.  I still use it for reference and do not pick up my uke without that book nearby."
1,5,Replaced my beloved Small clone chorus with this pedal and I'm glad I did. This is one lush pedal and it's all analog. This pedal also sounds great with gain.
0,2,"I tried this in front, in the middle, and at the end of an effects chain, as well as by itself, plugged into the effects loop of my Mesa Boogie Mark V amplifier.  Whenever it is in the path, as soon as I engage my effects loop, the signal level drops considerably.  It did not matter whether the pedal was on or not.  The chorus effect is good, but I don't want my volume to drop every time I turn on my effects loop.  I have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that I use, so I can't raise the send any more."
1,5,This is a great effect! Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products have always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable. This Analog Chorus pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should. It's great to add low and high end cut to make it even more versatile. It is also very small and will not take a lot of space in your board. I actually believe this pedal will exceed all your expectations. You will not be dissappointed at all. Ships fast. Highly recommended.
1,4,"This pedal has a great range of function (with variable width and depth) along with an independent level control, and tone controls for low and high frequency cutoffs. It also has a dry through output.It can go from low depth high speed shimmers, to high depth, low speed oscillations, to ridiculous warble.The pedal is light weight, very high quality, durable, quite good looking, and all around a good pedal to play around with.Cons: The blue led, like many blue leds, is VERY bright; I usually cover them up with a sticker so I can see the setting on the pedal.It can also be easy to accidentally touch the pedal casing with the positive barrel of when plugging in (this can frighteningly spark). So make sure to plug in the power adapted into the pedal before plugging in the wall."
1,5,"I had sworn off Chorus pedals years ago, the sounded so sterile and digital the sucked the tone out your guitar and amp and made everything sound the same. Not with the MXR Analog Chorus, very musical and transparent, I like the presets recommended in the instruction manual. the stereo out is very cool for using two amps . and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and will last forever. By the way this is the exact same pedal as the Zak Wylde chorus pedal with out all the cheese paint job , not all of us are metal heads"
1,5,"To start off with the unit is all metal construction and built like a tank, it is very easy to set up and use the controls are self-explanatory.You can get a wide variety of coarse effects from this unit from the very subtle to the crazy overdriven David Gilmour sound.One distinct feature this pedal has that sets it apart from the rest is you can actually use base and trouble cut off controls to tailor the sound to make it sound less tinny  and more full.Overall for the money this is a fantastic value well-built and has outstanding sound get it you won't be disappointed!"
1,5,I had used some Boss CE-5 and CH-1 and substituted them with this unit. It's has a cool analog/vintage sound of chours.
1,5,"This cable is an amazing find. It simply works! I am not sure if some of the cables others have reviewed have had loose wiring in them, but the cable I received is perfect.I plugged the cable into my Windows laptop, waited 30 seconds while it recognized the cable and installed drivers, and I was good to go. I plugged in a dynamic microphone, opened the Audacity software program, hit record and it was amazing sound quality. I had previously used a variety of input devices from a JamHub to a Behringer USB line input device to an Art audio preamp to even going low-budget with just a cable directly into the microphone input of the (ThinkPad) laptop. This cable provides as high quality of an audio signal as any other reasonably priced device I have used.There are, however, a few limitations...- This cable is mono only, i.e. not for stereo recording. This seems obvious, but is worth mentioning for those who have less experience with this type of stuff.- This cable only works with Dynamic Microphones. If your microphone is a Condenser microphone, you either need a battery powered microphone or some type of 'phantom' power source to power the condenser microphone.The really good things?- This cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the Audacity software. Some input devices are either very hot (too much level) or have hardly any gain at all, so this cable works very well by providing just the right level.- This cable works amazingly well with a direct box to record a bass guitar, acoustic/electric guitar, keyboard, etc. I have a lot of direct boxes and this works well on all of them. I was able to record a bass guitar track with about the least amount of fuss ever (think three minutes setup time from thinking of the idea to hitting record) using just this cable and a Hosa www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WS1Q4E/ direct box I purchased from Amazon as well."
0,1,The HDE xlr to usb is ubs. I have the same problem the red blinking syndrome. I learneda long time ago dont try to fixsomething you paid for send it back. So I did Thanks Hde for wasting my time. Go sell your snake oil to someone else.....I
1,5,"Very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone (or instrument using a direct box) to the USB input of a computer. I plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my PC. Win 7 automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes. I then recorded some vocals using Audacity, a free open source download. Recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all. Recording level was great, not sure why some reviewers said it was too low. Note that this will not provide phantom power, nor does the item description imply that it will. USB only provides 5VDC and phantom power usually requires 18-48VDC. Unless there is some kind of power converter (which would be much too large to fit in this compact package) it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires. Use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy!"
0,2,"This cable was very affordable, but you get what you pay for. It sounded brilliant while it wasn't broken, for about the 4 hours of runtime. It works if it isn't abused at all, but if you abuse it in any way at all, your out an XLR cable. I do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage."
1,4,"Needed to get mic into computer via the USB port.  Just try to find.  Amazon had it, and at a good price."
1,5,"Having purchased many &#34;A&#34; frame and more &#34;traditional&#34; style stands, this one has quickly become my favorite. Not only is the padding much better than the rest of them, this thing is very sturdy and the casters actually work. Only thing lacking a bit is the instructions, but it's easy enough to put together that they aren't really needed. I'll probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon."
1,5,I almost gave it 4 stars since you have to be smart to assemble it.  Directions don't include the proper details.  I would write them but that's their job.  I spend 20 minutes instead of 5 or so it they explained the process better.  The stand with my guitars looks awesome.  It's perfect for 2-3 acoustics and 1-2 electric guitars.  I wouldn't load it with 7 since they would inevitably bump while putting them in or taking them out.  Nice addition to my studio.
0,2,Well... its a stand..  its super cheap and i don't mean the price.  the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back.. i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back.  its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well.  Instructions were ok..  came with more parts than what were required... all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra.. the guitars do not sit very well in this stand... i will use it until i can find a better one.. it will get replaced.. i really should send this POS back to Amazon.  the concept is great but the execution of it sucks. it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand..  there are better options out there for something portable.  this stand is worth 10.00 tops... if i had it to do all over i would save my money.
1,5,I can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand. It is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use. Assembly was pretty easy and took little time.
1,5,"I bought the stand to better organize my personal studio space and I'm satisfied enough to consider purchasing a second (too many instruments for my own good).Still, it could use some tweaks: I'd recommend putting lock washers under all the nuts - very inexpensive and keeps the bolts tight - especially on carpet where there's even more tendency for the pieces to shift about under stress. It also protects against over-tightening the bolts that can bend the relatively lightweight metal arms and support bars.I can imagine people feeling queasy about storing expensive instruments on a stand that feels like it wouldn't take much to tilt over forwards, but you should be able to convince yourself that the downward force of the instrument bodies (especially electrics) counteracts the weight of the necks leaning into the top support - making a forward fall unlikely.Still, for sanity's sake, I'd position the stand close to a wall. At first, this causes a dilemma because your headstocks will extend beyond the front plane of the stand. But it's easy to rig up one or two 6-8 inch support pieces from wood or pipe insulation-covered metal to brace the stand against the wall while providing comfortable clearance for the headstocks. Removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort.The design can hold a variety of instrument body shapes; the trick is to find the optimum balance point but it's not hard: I fit an acoustic bass guitar, a 335-shaped Ibanez Artist, Strat, SG-shaped bass, J-Bass, a Martin OM-1, a long neck bouzouki, six-string banjo and a Nick Lucas-shaped Recording King acoustic on it. That said, I don't max out the seven slots - I'll use at most 5, simply because different shapes make catching a strap and banging an instrument too easy when they're that close. If I were storing all electric guitars or basses with similar shapes, I might be comfortable with six or even seven.I wouldn't use this stand on stage - and by 'on stage' I mean any setting with people moving about who might come into contact with it, including a house party, basement jam session, etc. It's simply not sturdy enough, physics or no. But for my needs it works well and saves me a lot of floor space where it's tight to begin with."
1,5,"I love this thing and for the price you just can't beat it. It seems sturdy and I have gigged with it for a couple months now and it is holding up. I haven't tried it with acoustic guitars but it fits my 7 electric guitars very nicely. Set up only took about 10 min or so and it included all the tools necessary. I saw the same one in guitar center a week later for $60 more. Like I said, for the price you can't beat it."
1,4,"Easy to put together,stable and cheap. 100% would recommend. I want to get more guitar,just to get a other one."
1,5,"got these stands to hold my guitars, they are o.k. for at home but i really wouldn't recomend them for gigging too much. they bend at the welds pretty easy and might break"
0,3,"This might be a really, really nice stand, but the one I received was defective-one of the small top separator arms that keep the guitar necks apart was unattached and won't attach, so I have to return it for a refund.  I'll probably buy another one afterward with the hopes that it's intact this time."
0,3,"It works as advertised but be aware it's not for anything freshly painted or any guitar with a nitro finish. It will mess up the finish. Nitro is usually used on your more expensive guitars like my Gibson Les Paul for example. It's amazing how many guitar stands can mess up your finish, that's a pretty major design flaw. But they just keep making them.Anyway, it is a nice little stand but be careful. If you have a nice guitar you'll want to cover the padding with some cloth to avoid possible damage."
1,5,After having collected a few guiters through the years I needed the kind of stand to hold certain ones in particular.
1,5,Works well
1,4,"First of all, this is a $40 7-guitar stand. It's not a high-end $200 pro stand. That being said, the materials are decent. It seems strong and stable. I would not recommend it if you plan on using it to move from gig to gig. I bought it to have a convenient place to keep our 5 guitars and basses handy. Rather than having 5 individual stands, this stand is perfect for keeping our living room neat.The metal is decent, but if you tighten the screws too much, the metal does flex/warp.So far so good."
1,4,it is not that large and really organizes my instruments.  The only detriment is that I leave my instruments out and they tend to collect dust.  Cover them with a sheet or something.
0,2,This stand is ok for light home use. I would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel. Very cheaply made but does the job. Guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot. You must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on  the rack. Avoid if you can spend more.
1,5,"I am trying to learn to play violin, but was having difficulty finding the proper fingering for the notes. This has been very helpful for me to check finger position. I will be removing it when I can consistently find the proper placing for my fingers. This has also help me in tuning the violin."
1,5,"Don't Fret Position Indicator for 4/4 Violin or 14&#34; Viola is very helpful tool, especially for beginners. If you start to learn violin - buy it, it will make your study much prettier."
1,5,"I had thin cut strips of duct tape on my fretboard before and then i saw this, not only is it alot more visually appealing but its more accurate aswell"
1,4,"This item was purchased because I'm doing self-teaching on the fiddle.  I figured it would be a good idea to have this to train my fingers while I'm learning.  Since I'm used to fretted instruments this helps me visualize where my fingers should go.  I like that it has the different colors for the different finger positions.  I also like that it has perferations along the template so you can put as much or as little of the indicator on the fingerboard as you want.It did take some measuring to get this in place.  I had to be very careful to put it on squarely.  The closer I got to the bridge the more difficult it got and it was a little out of line, but not so much that it would affect how to use the template.One things I had to deal with was to make sure I had a MM measuring devise.  The bridge of the violin had to be 325 mm from the nut.  It took some doing, but I was finally able to get the bridge in the correct position in order to make sure the fred indicator would give me the correct notes."
1,4,"Good for any beginner, but consultation with a teacher, if you have one, is recommended.  For ham fisted persons, positioning is not easy; for lossening strings, proper bridge resetting, and exact measuring of string length from the nut to the bridge is required.  Measuring requires a hard ruler with a full 330 milimeters (325 required) - bet you don't have one - or a technician's measuring tape and confident measuring skill.  Measuring is best with a cooperative assistant.  Bridge distance can be first set by good measurement and tightening the D string to hold the bridge position, measurement check, tightening the A string, measurement check, removal of the backing material and good positioning of the guide while eliminating the bubbles followed by tightening the 1st and 4th strings and tuning the instrument. Do it!  You'll appreciate your instrument a lot more than it takes to just pick it up and start practicing.  If you ain't intelligent, Good Luck!  You'd best be served with dot stickers."
1,5,"Excellent picks, with nicely rounded corners to the essentially triangular shape and nicely beveled edges to make tremolo playing easy and smooth.  The only problem I have is that I keep changing my mind between whether I want a crisp corner for my picking for clarity or a pick like these for smoother playing.  These are a great addition to any mandolin player's case because they give the player a nice alternative to trying to use one of the rounded corners on a pick like a Fender heavy."
1,5,"These picks are comparable in shape and feel to Grisman's Dawg Picks (and frankly, cheaper). The thickness and rounded bevel will absorb a lot of high end from your tone and, depending on how you play, this may or may not be acceptable.In my opinion, if you play with a relatively free and loose wrist, without anchoring your fingers or palm on the mandolin face or bridge, you'll get a woody, warm tone with plenty of definition and good volume. Varying the horizontal contact point along the strings can bring out a bit more high end. I play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks. (For guitar I prefer a 1 mm traditional tri-corner shape but that's a different review). If, however, you're really a fan of a biting high treble sound, these picks are probably not your best choice unless you're willing to put a sharper edge on the bevel with a file and fine sandpaper. In fact, a pack of 12 three corner picks can be an economic way to experiment with pick shape and bevel angle if you're searching for your ideal tone.If you support your hand by resting your palm or fingers on the mandolin, chances are your attack, tone and volume are generally softer and I think these picks will produce an unacceptably dull tone. Tweaking the shape may still leave you feeling as though you're not benefiting from the large mass of the pick and it's just slowing you down. For such a lighter stroke, I'd recommend the 1 mm tri-corner I use for guitar."
1,5,"This pick is well designed for mandolin playing.  Unlike standard guitar picks, it has generously radiused corners.  It's also stiff and comfortable to hold when playing."
1,4,"I was looking for picks comparable to the three that came with my Fender beginner's mandolin set, worried I'd permanently lend them out or otherwise lose them. Having a dozen similar--a few for me and a few to share--meets the need! He heavy feel and very rounded edges make for a very mellow sound and allow for a quiet practice, especially when compared to lighter weight and pointer guitar picks."
1,5,"Picks are personal thing and even then everyone seems to change once in a while.  I really like the feel of this hard little pick with the round edge, which gives a warm round sound, but if you like to have the bluegrass banjo sound, all you need to do is file down one edge to what you'd like and you can have it all.  Great pick, I recommend it."
1,5,"This works amazing! It is very thick, which is great for a nicer sound on the mandolin. It also works great for a guitar. It works really nice with steel strings, but I have yet to test it on my ukuleles nylon strings."
0,3,"This is a good pick.  They give the strings a sweet sound and slide off the strings nicely.  However they do have a really annoying clicky sound that is not so hot.  After trying a few others I settled on Wegen Picks.  They make the Golden Gates sound bleak in comparison.  Wegens definitely click less, are easier to grip and bring out the natural woody sound and character of the instrument.  If you are looking for something that will progress with you, you may wish to look elsewhere."
1,4,"I chose this rating because even though it is an Epiphone, a Les Paul and affiliation with Gibson it is made in China NOT the USA as one would think by the name affiliations.  I think that fact should be pointed out in the advertisement that is is NOT a USA product. When opened, the white pick guard as showen in the picture was missing from the body of the instrument but I did find it in the pocket of the soft carry case. The white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory. So someone messed up in QUALITY CONTROL. With that said, I find the finished look is fine without the guard, the tone sounds good when not electrified and the sound is good when electrified. I decided NOT to send it back because everything else appeared ok when using it."
1,4,"The ukulele is very cool looking, it plays nice, it doesn't sound as nice as a more expensive ukulele, it comes with cheap strings, but it's a very fun ukulele.  I think it's worth a hundred dollars."
0,2,"I really like Epiphone products. They are well-made, easy to play guitars. I also purchased an Ep Les Paul Special 2 Ebony from Amazon a while back. But, I received this Uke defective. I expected when I plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but I couldn't here anything at all. Totally dead. There are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down. I'm disappointed because I expect Gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory. I actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when I got over to his house and it didn't work in front of him. I just requested a return/exchange from Amazon. If the next one works ok I may buy a second one for me. I seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through Amazon. I had to send back my Dean 12 string elec-acoust to Amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem.  I do want to state that this is a beautiful Uke with nice feeling nylon strings, fine wood high polished surface, high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically.  The actual guitar looks even BETTER in person than in the picture. If this Uke was working 100% I would have given it a 4 or 5."
1,5,"I love this uke! it came fast. such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy!sounds amazing, intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune. it has a nice mellowtone unplugged and when you plug it in it sounds amazing! the finish is amazing perfectone of my favorite instruments i ever, owned totally worth buying for the priceyou will not regret it!"
1,5,"Beautifully finished. Everything about the construction of instrument is unbelieveable. Nice sound in the acoustic too. If this is an indicator of Indonesian made instruments, then all string instruments should be made there. Epiphone has outdone itself. I absolutely adore this instrument. I would love to have a Baritone Uku of this same design."
1,4,"Dunno how, but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasn't installed.  The pickguard is no biggie, I actually didn't want it on there (it seems oversized to me).  If I wanted it on there tho, it's got a peel off sticky back.  Not having a cable was kinda a big deal.  I sent an email to Epiphone (Gibson), got a response within a day and after sending in proof of purchase, they promised to send me a cable.  Nice customer service.As far as the Uke, the finish on mine was perfect, no blemishes I can see.  I did change out the strings, and it does sound a 'little' better I suppose, but not that much.  Probably would have messed around on the stock strings a bit longer, but I listened to the reviews and did a change right away.  For $100, if you want a uke, this one looks awesome and plays well."
1,5,I received a selection of pics for a reasonable price. The variety of materials and thicknesses offered good opportunity to explore my options.
1,5,great picks. i like the feel and the control it provides. i like its texture and the size. just perfect.
1,5,"I don't know how much you can say about picks, but this is a versatile pack. You get a multitude of types and there are 2 of each thickness. If you use a variety of picks or are wanting to test out other types of picks, this is for you."
1,5,Need a little variety in your life? well... Its nice never having to look for a pick they're just always around now
1,5,Simply a nice assortment of picks to try.  Worth a purchase just to experience the differences a simple pick change can make.
1,5,Great Selection of Dunlop Picks  it was a good choice of finding what type of picks i preferred.. Didnt know until i sampled quiet a few..
1,4,They are picks for guitars and they work. They also have pretty colors. Right now I am just writing to get the required words out. If you dont want anything heavy this is good for you.
1,4,"I only use a few of them, it's good to find what style fits you. I'd recommend it for finding what suits you."
1,5,"lots of different thicknesses and textures to try out and see what works or like the best, great picks sampler"
1,4,"Not cheap as far as pics are concerned, but it's definitely nice to get a variety pack now and then.  If you're new, it helps you find what you like.  if you're experience, you might like to keep different pics around while searching for that new sound."
0,3,"i use thin picks, (.38, .46 and .50)  so this pack gets you thicker ones too which i don't use.  i actually like the dunlop brand/material so once i get used to thicker ones, i'll try these.  the pack only have .50 and thicker in case you're looking for very thin ones.  if so, then don't buy this sample pack.  go and buy the Dunlop Nylon .38 or .46"
1,5,I bought the wrong pack(Was supposed to buy the light/medium pack) but its alright these picks let me try out a bunch of different gauges and materials to see what fit me best. My favorite pick out of this bunch was  the Dunlop Jazz 3 pick. It would be great if the item name was changed to like 'Dunlop 12 Med/Heavy pick variety pack' but that might be me being too picky.
0,3,The sampler pack was a good variety of pick thicknesse and are useful in finding out what type of picks are most useful in playing various guitar styles.
1,4,"This is a pretty decent guitar. If you can get past the brite orange color of the sound board. Was disappointed that the electronics are a tuner that you have to switch from string to string (why would they put a tuner in this six string guitar, that is made for a seven string?)  and a volume nob that goes from low to high. No tone control, no presence control. Hint: Don't go to guitar shops and play a better guitar than you can afford. It will just leave everything else you can afford seem lacking."
1,5,"I purchased this as my first classical guitar because I need a guitar I can plug in, overall I'm extremely impressed with it, it stays in tune pretty well, has shockingly low action for a classical, sounds great plugged in and unplugged, has a built in tuner, comfortable to play, overall I love the guitar, well worth the money!"
1,5,This is a great guitar for the money!!!! It has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments! The built in tuner works great and plugged up this guitar has a very natural and clean sound. I would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it!!!!!
1,4,"This guitar is pretty good for the price. The only reason it has 4 stars is because my first and 2nd string keep detuning. Might be the weather, but strangely it keeps tune in DADGAD. I think I may need to tighten some screws. Anyway, not a bad choice at all if you want a nice classical."
1,5,"My C5CE Washburn has been a very good purchase. I was looking for a guitar with enough space between strings so that my fingers would not mute strings accidentally while practicing cords. I prefer guitars having solid woods, not laminated like this one. It has the ability to plug into an amp, has easy access to the battery, has a built in easy to use tuner, and the wiring dose not rattle about. It has a good compensated saddle, the frets are level and do not buzz, has a truss rod in the neck, and has a bound rosewood fingerboard. I have always liked the sound of classic guitars, like the option to plug in, and am more impressed by sound than brand name.A person who has small fingers might be better off looking for a narrower neck. This is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar. It rings out very well, so it is not a quiet guitar but is not likely to disturb your neighbors unless plugged in.Mine has some edges not well stained, likely due to glue squeeze out during assembly. Top is a bit wavy, from buffing. Still has some orange peel but not a lot.  Lastly, the nut and saddle are too high for my preference. Some people may be turned off by the orange color of the top, sort of a classic color that I have gotten used to now.Other guitars in this price range are typically made with laminated tops or backs, this model is not. I was not clear enough above where I mentioned laminated woods.If something happened to it, I would be likely to replace it with another one just like it. A very cost effective, good sounding, well made guitar. Good job Washburn."
1,4,"This is an amazing guitar for the price. I wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection. The guitar has good tone and action. The built in tuner is a nice addition because nylon strings stretch when they are new so you have to retune frequently.  The guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in.  The pickup works nicely but is a little sensitive and loud.  The guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified, but I prefer the acoustic sound.  The finish is a bit more orange than pictured. You could spend a lot more money on a classical guitar and not end up with a better guitar than this one."
1,5,I bought these for my teen son who plays the bass. He absolutely loves them and they seem to be lasting a good while as well. Nice sounds.
0,3,"I used a felt pick that was made in the 1940s for a long time and it finally disintegrated over time and became unusable. I bought a set of Mahalo Felt Picks and while they seem nice, they're too stiff to get a clean sound when strumming and I get a raspy, harsh tone when picking single strings.I know many people love these felt picks, but I've found a set of soft rubber picks here on Amazon that give me a tone that's much closer to the sound of my dearly departed vintage felt pick."
1,4,"I bought these because they were an &#34;add-on&#34; offer and I'm glad I did.  I don't play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass. These are a little too soft for guitar (check out the Dunlops) but I'm going to make sure I have some of these around, too."
1,5,I love these picks. I bought them just as an add on to get free shipping but they turned out being a great buy. It is much louder than playing with just my fingers and changes the sound completely.
1,5,What can you say about a pick? These picks sound good and have lasted well. I have also found that felt uke picks produce a good sound on bass guitar.
1,5,"I don't often use a pick for my soprano uke. The Mahalo picks bring a clarity of tone that I really like, especially if I'm looking for a brighter sound."
1,4,these picks are bigger than i expected. easy to hold and very soft. they deliver a rather muted and softer sound than traditional picks.
1,4,MY THUMB GOT SORE!  I HADN'T PLAYED ANY OF MY STRING INSTRUMENTS FOR SOME TIME.  THE FINGER TIPS ON MY LEFT HAND WERE NO LONGER CALLUSED AND MY RIGHT UKULELE STRUMMING THUMB WAS TENDER FROM BEING OUT OF PRACTICE.  HENCE MY PURCHASE OF THESE FELT PICKS.  THE PICKS ARE FINE.  THEY ARE USEFUL.  MY ONLY COMMENT IS THAT I REALLY LIKE A FELT PICK THAT IS THICKER AND A LITTLE SOFTER.  THESE ARE GOOD BUT DIFFERENT.
0,3,We purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the Ukulele.  They seem to make a damper sound rather than allowing the strings to make music.  Not sure I would buy these again. But great to give the kids when I don't want to hear 6 Uke's practicing at the same time.
1,5,"As a classical guitarist, I have never touched a pick to my nylon strings.  As a recent ukulele enthusiast, however, I have a little different approach.  In a group, if all are acoustic, a lead line of some sort has to push through the strummers.  I tried these.  Nothing against them.  They are good for strumming.  For lead, I needed to use something harder.  I went to a soft plastic or nylon pick.  It will still not be too good for the strings, but it does the sonic job I need.For a nice strum, these are fine."
1,5,"Recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun.. these, rubber picks, metal picks, etc. I play guitar.I'm not crazy about these for that purpose, but they aren't made for guitar obviously, so I can't fault them. They seem to be made well made. They are larger than I expected, and rather thick.Obviously these are made for ukes, so my review is probably not helpful to many. If you're like me and were looking for some variety for the guitar I'd suggest the rubber picks instead. They give a similar mellow sound without mudding up the tone, and they are easier and more comfortable to use also. Heck, maybe uke players should try those too?"
1,5,"Aloha friends! Simply put, if you have a ukulele, then these are the picks that you should be using. Cheers!"
0,3,"I thought these would give me more volume and a better feel for stumming my uke.  I don't use them much at all, preferring palin hand strumming to what these deliver."
1,5,nice comfortable very comfortable to use and easy to install on the guitar and was just like the picture showed.
0,3,Well I guess it works? I don't know what I was expecting. I was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar. I had to tie the other end around the guitar area but I don't know I guess it is okay it doesn't really bother me it is just that I wasnt expecting it. Also the actual band where I can put around my body is not THAT comfortable but it is okay and I can move around in it and secure it to my body.
1,5,"2&#34; wide, Nylon strap is well made, comfortable and should last many years. The ends are leather, sewn onto the strap. It has room for adjusting to fit almost anyone, short or tall. Comes in several colors."
1,4,My pet use to roam the car while driving.  He has learned to stay stationed and relaxes a lot more!
0,1,"I sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and I see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap, but I don't know why. Maybe other people don't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before. It wasn't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds, but once I got it on it was stiff and felt odd. It was very uncomfortable around my neck and I took it off my guitar in a matter of matters. I would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap. Unless you're just going for something that is inexpensive, does the job, and isn't designed for comfort."
1,4,"I bought three of these at the same time to replace some older straps that were starting to rip and fall apart. They are decent cheap guitar straps with a tight fit over the strap buttons. Two out of the three I bought are still performing well but one of them quickly cracked around the hole where that the strap button goes through and will occasionally slip off. Not a huge deal because that seems to happen with almost every guitar strap I've ever bought a one point or another but it happened quicker with this particular strap. I suppose, unless I have strap locks, there is no way around this."
1,4,"This was something I HAD to pick up, simply due to the price.  I own a Shure SM57 and compared to this, the sound is very close, not dead on, but I'd consider this over other mics for someone on a budget.The  top does not spin like the Shure and the weight is much lighter due to the material used to cut cost I'm sure, but none the less, it makes no difference sound wise.Overall, a great buy!"
1,5,"I've used this mic with my Tascam US-800 Audio Interface, and PC, to record a high school chorus concert, and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone. I placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone, and one as a piano/instrument microphone, and have gotten great results from both. The reproduction of the sound was very good. The mic seems very solid in build, and able to possibly take a little abuse, which is good with a travelling recording system, but I definately wouldn't TRY dropping one, even though they're a nice metal case, and metal grill. I'd recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals, and instrumentals, on a budget. I have yet to try these with micing guitar amps, but that's my next step, as well as drums."
0,1,"I ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap, the first one arrived in non working condition, wires inside werent even soldered, so i ordered a replacement, plugged it in and it didnt work either, the second wasnt soldered either.I know its cheap, but i expected it to at least work, do not buy"
1,5,"This is a great microphone for 10 bucks, (did I just say $10?....LOL) it does not have the same sound as a Shure SM 57, but it is kind of close. I used it as an overhead microphone on drums, recorded an acoustic guitar with it, and it worked perfect. Seen some reviews about &#34;hiss&#34; from this microphone, the &#34;hiss&#34; is from the cheap XLR into 3/4 connection (who uses that kind of connection anyway?, would have been great if it included a real XLR but cannot complain) after I swapped out the cheap cord and replaced it, hiss was gone, a no brainer really. I have been a producer/engineer for over 3o years, this is a great utility microphone, if you need an overhead, or a microphone to put in front of a guitar amp, slap it on percussion etc... it will work just fine, the sound, it is quite clean actually, for $10 it is a steal. If this one last a few months may pick up a couple more for my studio, as I can never have enough microphones. Every microphone has it uses. I would not recommended putting this up for a vocalist but as a utility microphone you cannot beat price and quality, well constructed pro like product."
1,5,"OK, I just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago. I did a little comparison to a pretty old SM57 that I've have since 1990ish and it was actually very good. The Pyle has more gain then the old 57 and as for sound I would say they are damn near identical to my ear. I did the A/B test by mic'ing a guitar cab and recording a hi gain metal guitar riff trying my best to keep the mic's in the very same positions. I would recommend for sure. Here's a link to an A/B comparison I did with an SM57. [...]"
1,5,"This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables. The included cable is light duty, but not bad if you treat it with respect.The mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows, smooth midrange and crisp highs. For almost any singer or announcer, this will be just what they need. The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise, making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production. The sound is unbelievable, especially at this price. For under twenty dollars, this Pyle-Pro mike can't be beat.One issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam DR40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable, the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics. Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem, but both mikes work perfectly with any other device. The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue, but usually not when using the XLR input."
1,5,"This mic is good considering the price. Does it sound exactly like a 57? No. Do it have a decent quality sound? Absolutely. If you're expecting an SM57, then buy an SM57. If you want something close, on. A budget, this is your mic. Great value and good sound."
1,5,they do the job great not a bad price for as many as you getgoing to buy some more for sure
1,5,I use to protect my microphones ...... of karaoke singers because they sing spit and that creates bad smell in the microphone .... very good product I recommend
1,5,They're round and they fit over microphones.  Work well to stop pops and lisps.  Have been very happy with them.
1,4,"These foam mike covers do exactly what they are made to do, and they do it just about average as you expect. My only complaint is they come packaged in a bag that allows them to be crushed and mis-shaped upon delivery. If your mike has a big enough ball, the ball will reshape the foam. Otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth, round look to it."
0,3,Nothing Fancy. Snug Fit for my Mic. Kinda of thin compared to others that I have seen. Bought extras in case others wanted to use my Mic.
1,4,So I have these old EV mics and the little foam piece on the inside of the ball dry rotted and crumbled.  These provided an easy inexpensive solution.  No complaints.
1,5,Work awesome :)
1,5,I have a few guitars and these hooks work extremely well without costing too much.I also like the clean almost modern lines and that they don'y look like hardware.Plus they are all padded afor protection.
1,4,I couldn't say that I loved it. It's only a guitar hanger. It just holds a guitar. If I needed another I would buy this type.
1,5,"I wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin, and this works great.  The arms are adjustable, so the instrument won't rest on the pegs.  The foam is good, and the hardware is included.  Plus, the price is great."
1,4,I am worried that I will damage my instruments if they are left standing around. This will allow me to show off and protect them.
1,5,"It's easy to install, very tough, and I love how it looks. It can support quite a bit of weight (assuming you properly installed it on a stud, and not in drywall) and helps with cable management on a rough day."
1,4,"I own a number of guitar hangers. This one was a good buy for the money. I have wood ones that are heavier and more attractive, but also a good deal pricier. For what I spent for this one, it is adequate as long as it &#34;holds Up&#34; (Pun intended)"
1,5,"Installs with two screws. I don't trust the sheet rock anchors that come with the screws. I drilled into wooden studs. It is firm, secure and would probably hold a 200 pound gorilla. These seem very well made. The prongs are adjustable to hold almost any stringed or bowed instrument. Some of the foam padding used in hangers and stands may cause a reaction with nitro cellulose finishes, so I will keep my eye on it for a while. Over all, it is a good way to display your instruments, it allows easy access and unclutters the floor in my very small music room. I bought 4 and going back for more."
1,5,"I was excited with how easy it was to set up, and it makes my music room look so much better with guitars hanging up instead of just sitting on the floor or on stands"
0,3,"I've got three of these to hold an acoustic, a mini strat, and a jazzmaster .... while I had no doubts about their capacity to hold the former I was somewhat leary about the later (it's quite a bit heavier than the other two) but after putting some weight on it and it not coming apart I have been trusting it ...Do Not fix these directly into drywall with the screws provided though they seem awfully small for the weight of a full-size electric (and I have my doubts about those plugs), the hanger will hold but the drywall might not, get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated for at least the weight of your instrument. I used a different setup, #10 philips (slotted round heads would have actually been better) to fix them to a nice piece of 3/4 x 6 x 6 pine and screwed that into the studs with some 2.5"" #12 screws. Needless to say it's not going anywhere. As a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall.OK, one month later and nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even for something as heavy as a Jazzmaster."
1,4,"Arrived promptly.  Nicely packaged.  Holding my instruments securely.  I'll likely order more, and would recommend these to anyone shopping for wall mounts."
1,5,"many similar products for much more money do not do as well as these simply designed easy to use & install hangars. They are reliable (so far), they do not hurt anything on your instrument, & I am using one for my heavy fretless bass as well as my guitars & violin! How self adjusting can they be!? apparntly - quite!"
1,5,"Easy install and great price. Shopped these for awhile and had to get all my guitars off the floor, bed, corners of room etc Installed in two minutes. Holds neck lightly - easy up easy down. Padded so does not scratch finish on neck. Will buy again."
1,5,"I use this item for my daughter 1/2 size guitar, its looks light in weight and firm, and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars."
1,4,Good thing I didn't trust the plastic anchors. I put a bit of weight on it & the screws came out of the anchors. The anchors stayed in the wall. I found a stud & it works & looks fine. Good inexpensive guitar hangers. I'm getting a few more!!
1,5,You have to pay a lot more at a guitar store for something like this.  Granted it doesn't look as nice but it does its job.  I put couple of them up and have my guitar hanging  on it without any problem.
1,5,"I just got them (I bought 5) and put them up, so I don't know about longevity. So far, though, they work great and seem to be sturdy enough. And the price is great!I am using them for a variety of instruments including steel string acoustic guitar, classical acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass guitar (4 string), and mandolin. The hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability."
0,3,"What makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently. If you have a standard size guitar neck, don't bother with that. I would have preferred something that was stationary that I could just stick the guitar in. As it is I have to jiggle and align it a bit, using 2 hands sometimes, which will be annoying after awhile. If I buy another it would be a standard hanger."
1,5,"Yes, I bought 3 and they fit all my guitars, mandolins, ukulele, bass.Very easy to install on the wall."
1,5,"I just got done installing these. My three guitars and mandolin take up virtually no room in my small house anymore, my guitars are decorating the wall at the same time, and my guitars won't tip over either. Not only was this the least expensive solution out there, but also the most space efficient (to keep my wife happy).I used the screws that came with the mounts and made sure that they went into a stud. You can usually find a stud by looking for a screw or nail that the drywallers didn't get covered with drywall mud. Once you've found one screw, then your studs are either 16 or 24 inches apart. With the mounts screwed into wood studs, I don't see any way these are coming down. The mounts fit everything from my 12 string acoustic, to my heavy electric Strat, to my mandolin beautifully.Gotta love Amazon. With so many options to choose from, you can come up with something great and inexpensive too. And the reviews give you an idea of what real consumers are experiencing with the product.BTW, this seller really got these to me fast. This was a great buying experience. Thanks DisplayGiftSCOM."
0,3,"This is very nice holder which holds my guitar in an accesible but safe from scratching place.  the mount screws were too low of quality to use though, I went and got my own mount screws (was able to use black ones that matched - better) as these did not work that well and I did not want to trust my expensive guitar to them."
1,4,Given to sister from mysel.  She noted it very compact and discreet in hanging instrument out of way of any impending fracture.
1,4,"light weight, easy to install, holds very well, does exactly what it was designed to do, hold a guitar on a wall"
1,5,"I was leery of this since it was half the total price of just about every other one I considered. Because of the return policy I took a chance and am not only glad I did, but am also thoroughly impressed with this hanger.First, I doubt if I could build one for anywhere near the price of this if I purchased the materials locally. Factor in that shipping (at the time of my purchase) is free and this is a no brainer.Installation is also a no bainer and made so by the mounting hardware that comes with the hanger.There is one concern you may have. If you have instruments with nitrocellulose finishes the protective rubber sleeves on the hanging fork may eat into those finishes. Personally, mine are being used to hang a cheap Squire Strat and J-bass, and an Epiphone Les Pail Junior II - instruments more decorative than functional. I am not saying the sleeves will ruin the finish, but merely raising that possibility to help you to make a purchase decision.The bottom line, though, is if you are hanging guitars that do not have a nitrocellulose finish these hangers are a bargain. In fact, they are probably the best deal you are likely to find and are worth every cent."
0,1,"It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china.  Any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell.  If you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up.  If you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. I have decided to build my own"
1,4,"I lost a recording/rehearsal space I shared with some musician friends when it burned down from an electrical fire during 'superstorm' Sandy late last year.  A total loss - and we had no insurance (we sure learned our lesson).So, we rented a new space (this time it's nowhere near the shore) and we are re-building.  We're starting from scratch, and little odds and ends like guitar hangers add up after a while (it's bad enough we had a number of instruments, amps, and other equipment to replace).  So if we can save a few bucks here and there, it helps.I bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good. After I tried it and it worked fine, I went back and bought another 9 of them.  We have guitars, basses, ukeleles and mandolins hanging from them - they work on all sizes.  We use those wide-threaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall.  Like I said, they're nothing fancy, but they get the job done!"
1,4,"I have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio. However, I wanted to add a few to our rehearsal space but didn't want to spend a lot. These did the trick fine. They are perfect to rest your axe for a bit without a guitar stand getting in your way. Especially for the price. Okay, they are not high end, but I didn't need high end ones."
1,5,"The hanger was very easy to install, holds my acoustics safely,the instruments are easy to take down and put back in the hanger.The product arrived within 2-3 days, I couldn't believe how fast it got here.And yet the price is the best part of all."
1,5,"works out great for my two Ukus,,  hung it on the wall, looks good and is easy to adjust etc."
1,4,"The wall mount is very good, adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly. The screws & anchors are poor. If you are not putting this into a stud, go get you some better anchors. Do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only."
1,5,"While I wouldn't trust these to hold up my electric guitars, I have found other uses for them and have 2 of them now. The 1st one I used to try and hold my Dean From Hell guitar but it just mashed that foam around the yokes into nothing and didn't want it to damage my baby. So I ended up using it to hang my Rock Band guitar. This 2nd one I'm using to hang up my Beats Pros.I chose this product over some simple hook to hang my headphones is because of the foam covered yokes. I figured if you spread the weight over 2 cushioned points instead of a single unprotected point of a hook that the head cushion would hold up better. And the distance of the yokes means that the ear cushions won't ever touch the wall.This is a fantastic product if you understand it's limitations. I would recommend this for acoustic instruments, any type of RB/GH guitars, and probably your lighter/cheaper/mostly plastic electric guitars...or even headphones that you'd like to baby."
1,5,This is just what I have been wanting for a while now. I have my Les Paul style guitar hanging right by my computer desk and that baby gets played a whole lot more than when it was in the case! A floor stand worked fine until I knocked it over one day:( Now it stays on the wall and away from danger but never out of reach!
1,5,"It's not a thing of beauty so if looks is what you are after then this wall mount isn't for you. If you are looking for a solid, easy and convient place to hang your guitar where it won't get stepped on or kicked over then this is for you. It works great to hang a standard size guitar on. There is a little wiggle room left so a oversize may fit but I am not sure. It has a soft foam cover over the steal arms to protect your guitar, hangs by the neck where the head stock curves out so the tuning pegs aren't bumped and hangs straight, just touching the wall with the body. I recommend it."
1,5,Great hook!  Supports a lot of weight.  Looks good on any wall.I would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application.
1,4,"I ordered eight of these after reading the reviews.  I have five guitars, including two Les Paul's and they hold them just fine.  I give them four stars.  The are fine for, I believe, all guitars at home, but I wouldn't use them for retail or something like a school.  They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it's just a rivet the holds them together.  The wall anchors that they send with them are a joke.  like the other reviewer said, you really should find a stud to mount them to, but if you must use wall anchors, use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall.  All in all these are sturdy and stable (when anchored to a stud) and I'll use more if I have the need."
1,5,I have had &#34;swing trees&#34; for many guitars for years. Usually they cost $10-15. This hanger is as good (plastic base not wood like some others) as any of the wood ones. Comes with wall anchors but I usually look for a stud to mount on. Soft cushioning. Weight of guitar keeps the arms (which swivel to allow for proper fit) snug about the neck. The thing came in 2 days and at $4 and free shipping it is a true bargain.
1,5,"Wanted to hang my guitars on the wall.  These Hooks are padded, and rotate a little.  Provides a strong, non damaging support for some fine guitars.  The difficulty in installing was I wanted them to be screwed into a solid wall stud.  I had to attach them to a wood board, that I attached to the wall.  This also provided a additiional 3/4&#34; separation from the wall.  The guitars are less likely to bang on the wall."
1,5,"I love this wall hanging mount. Of course, you should use longer screws than what they give you and you should make sure to mount it in a stud, or use drywall backing screws, etc, but that's just common sense.The actual product works perfectly and exactly as described. The arms are adjustable & stay where you put them. This fits my 5string Fender Jazz Bass as well as my acoustic guitar & violin (and even holds the neck without touching the pegs, if you want it to). I will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments.This is a very well designed product that works just like you want it to."
1,5,Got them in 3 days and love them. So much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing.
1,4,"This is a cheaper alternative to the &#34;String Swing&#34; wall mount-- considerably less expensive.  It works fine.  It's easy to mount, easy to adjust and holds the instrument well.  The only downside is that the wall anchors aren't the heavy-duty plastic screw-in types but the smaller drill-a-hole-and-hammer-in-place types, which are neither as convenient nor as solid a mount as the others.  Of course you can always purchase a couple of screw-in heavy-duty mounts and you'll still save considerably.This of course doesn't have the beautiful hardwood finish of the String Swing.  For the lower price you get black plastic.  But it's sturdy enough, it looks fine and it does the job.  If it had sturdier wall mounts I'd give it 5 stars.  As it is, the cheaper and less-trustworthy mounts bring it 4 stars and a nod for being an inexpensive alternative. It is great for hanging ukuleles and mandolins and with sturdier screw-in mounts, should hold any size guitar."
1,4,"I bought this holder and then mounted it on a stand I built of cherry and maple for my uke.  It does the job.  It could be just a little stiffer in its adjustment, but it stays where I put it, so no complaints."
1,5,"I keep all my guitars in my room and I had to many stands cluttering it up. The screws they sent with were plenty long enough and all three that I got are holding guitars to the wall, on drywall nonetheless. So given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem. They all are sturdy enough, and i have always been suspect of wall hangers. best deal and does the job."
1,5,"I just received my Blue Radius Shock Mount, and I was immediately floored by the the size and looks of the unit. It reminds me a set piece from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", the rings around Saturn or something built by Tesla. It's a beautiful thing, certain to impress anyone who might sit in front of it to be recorded. Certainly beats the homemade 4 inch PVC pipe and bungee cord shock mount I previously had made and my Yeti mounted to. What is impressive about this mount is you have full and clear access to the the Yeti's 3 knob's, mute switch and USB/Headphone plugs on the bottom of the mic, whereas my homemade version gave me fits with knob access. Once you screw the Yeti into the machined shock mount base, there are teflon or maybe white delrin washers which allow you to swivel the mic easily to access the back knobs or move it toward any position, say a guest speaker with great ease. The build is hefty, machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws. The elastic suspension bands are not going to fly across the room, as they do on most shock mounts, because they are not threaded on hooks, but securely fastened to brackets, then the holding screws. The Radius also allows you to mount the Yeti on a boom stand, upside down, which I have always been told is the best way to mount a condenser type mic so dust and moisture (spit) does not build up near the capsules or internal electronics, it just falls, as gravity allows.Does a shock mount make a difference in sound? To my ears, yes, especially if you are recording into say, a laptop on a table, the fans and hard drive are going to vibrate, coloring your overall sound with unwanted hum. Although the mic stand the Yeti comes with does an O.K. job of dampening vibration, it is not going to give you as much isolation as the Radius, which will be noticed when the gain controls are turned up. There is also the science of unwanted resonance from instruments, rooms or cabs vibrating your stands, that's why you see most professional studios using shock mounts, you just get a cleaner sound. In a test, the Radius works like a charm, even from pounding on my mixing desk. A 9.0 earthquake is not going to cause any vibration.On the down side, just to play Devils Advocate, The Radius is huge, and may nor be suitable for tight spots or portability. That said, the Yeti is also a big microphone, and once mounted, may add six inches to the overall space you will need to use this setup properly. Next, when you un mount the Yeti from it's built in stand, you are going to have gaping screw holes in the side of the mic. I fixed that by screwing the old Yeti stand screws back into the holes, which actually looks kind of neat to me. To some maybe, it will look like bolts in the Frankenstein Monsters neck, but I think it all fits together. Next, smaller base microphone stands will want to tip, either angle the Yeti plus Radius back, or get a bigger stand, this is the one I have and would highly reccomend, theSamson SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand. Lastly, this mount will only work, as far as I can see, with a Blue Yeti or Blue Yeti Pro microphone, maybe some other mics will work, but not likely.In conclusion, the Radius is an easy set up, works great and makes a Yeti look retro/futuristic sexy! Yeah it actually looks really cool, like a spaceship blasting off or landing, take your pick, I know people coming into my studio are going to say, ""What The heck is that, and where can I get one!?"" I may tease and say it's and award or art piece.Addendum 12/13/2011If you thread another shock mount into the Radius, you get double protection. It also looks great to talent in your studio. Over Kill or Uber Cool, you decide. See Pictures."
0,2,"It did not perform. Looks cool, but thats it. Very large and inconvenient. Would not recommend this because I would not recommend the blue yeti."
0,3,"Cool design, makes a big difference in you audio. Even careful hand tightening will break the thumbscrew. Screw is actually two pieces (wtf?) of worlds crappiest pot metal.  Supposedly a new tightener design is on the way."
1,5,"after trying to rig something up, I decided to just go with this mount for my Yeti. It did not disappoint: the fit was perfect, install was easy (use your logic), and the microphone looks sexy as hell on it."
1,4,"I started doing quite a bit of VoiceOver work at work and needed to get the yeti microphone up and off of my desk. After attaching it to a microphone stand I found too much noise transition in my recordings and needed to isolate the Yeti Microphone.  This seemed like the best option for that.Upon installing the mount I had to take it all apart to get the microphone orientation right in the holder so that the microphone diaphragm was facing me. Straight out of the package this is designed to be mounted straight on with the stand directly in front of you. Unfortunately, if your microphone stand is coming from the sides, you have to take the inner ring out, rotate it to where you want it, and reattach the rubber bands.  Easy enough as I completed this is one minute.After using it for a while, the isolation is good, but not great. I think the bands are a little tight for this microphone. I see online that blue uses this same isolator on a bunch of different mics making this a universal holder.  This probally works great for the heavier applications but the bands are so tight on this mic that it is almost a solid mount. It needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings. I have other isolators in my studio that have much heavier mics and way softer bands.Going to get a replacement band from another provider and install it on this unit to see if it makes a difference.It's does its job, it just could do it better with softer bands."
1,5,Just as the others have said.  Its cheap with little to no padding but gets the job done as a dust cover and if you need something handy to transport your bass to and from gigs or to put the bass into storage.Its a perfect fit for Fender Squire J Bass.  I also got my Samick CR-13 short scale to fit in there but it was a tight fit so not the ideal choice for Short Scale bassesBut Im happy with it for under eleven bucks it gets the job done and I would buy it again
0,3,This bag is super cheap and flimsy with almost no protection for your guitars at all but since it's reflected in the cost.
1,5,this is very easy to put the guitar in to because it zips around the whole end and can be carried in your back
1,4,"Keeps gear dry.Not for airplane travel or shipping, but perfect for spare guitars.Zipper works fine; fabric as good as gig bags three times as much."
0,3,I recently purchased a Epiphone EB-3 bass and it didn't come with a case/bag. So when I found this one and decided for the price it was worth the try. It is VERY thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really. Not to mention that it has issues fitting a side by side into the bag but inlines seem to fit just fine. All in all it's an okay bag but only if you have an inline and don't want much padding.
1,5,should have kept this....I returned it cause I purchased a zoom r16....big mistake!! miss it on smaller projects and my mxl990 sounded wonderful when hooked up to this super versital mixer.....my uncle has one and uses it for podcasts on his camping trips with vw freaks! he thinks it great too
1,5,"it does the job to do my home made music demos, nothing professional though. im happy with it after all and recommend but not for professional purposes."
1,5,"This is my first mixer. I'd been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from USB-powered mics like the Blue Snowball to something a little more professional and, of course, that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups.Thus, I am an amateur and you'll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional.Anyway, my pros and consPros1. This thing is way smaller than I expected. I can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesn't take up a lot of desk space. It fits well where I put it.2. It works as intended. I use this with a GLS ES-57 mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good. I have my windows volume set at 75 and the gain is up at about 60%. I have no hissing and no problems. I did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co-host (we do it over Skype) said I sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good. This is a stark improvement over the Blue Snowball.3. It's plug and play. I plugged it in, it installed the drivers, and it automatically set itself as the default microphone. Easy peasy.4. I use Reaper as my audio software and Reaper recognized it immediately.5. The dials and everything was easy to understand.Cons1. You can't plug this into a USB hub (or even an AC-powered USB hub) otherwise you'll get a hiss. This needs to be plugged directly into a computer.2. This high-jacks your audio defaults in Windows. To fix it, open your Control Panel, open the Sound, and set your Playback device to your speakers to fix the problem. Your sound will come out through your speakers as intended. Since I use this as my main mic, I left it as default in the Sound settings.Overall, for the price, this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs. I know there are better options but they are also more expensive and I'm on a budget. It's a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money. If you're like me and a single person doing YouTube video voice overs or podcasts, this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person. Worth every penny as long as it lasts. I'll update when/if it breaks down but until then, I do not regret this purchase."
1,5,The Behringer 302USB Premium 5-Input Mixer is just what the doctor ordered.  Nice unit and works perfectly for vocals/guitar/ bass guitar and keyboards.  Don't lock yourself down with a bad USB/ 1/4: cable
1,4,I bought this for my son so he could record with it. He does stuff on the internet with other people musically and says it works good for him.
1,5,"This mixer is awesome, I couldn't get it where I live, so I bought it on Amazon, it works great!! I plugged my Shure mic, and my acoustic electric guitar to the Line In, and also my ipod to the 2track, and everything works great!! Great sound, with the right parameters, you just have to adjust a little here and there, and it will work great, so far no buzz or humm."
1,4,"Apple threw a curve at me when, with the new ""thin"" iMac, the company eliminated not only the Superdrive but the 3.5mm ""Audio In"" port that had been highly useful on previous models, especially for recording computer sounds with a single patch cord.  After trying a Griffin and Logitech device, I finally found a useful workaround with the Behringer UFO202 interface (there are 2 other very similar models by Behringer--the UCA202 and the UCA222). What sets these interfaces apart from the 302USB is a smaller footprint and a permanently-attached, ""dedicated"" USB cord.  Simply by plugging the USB cord into the USB port on my iMac I was able to record all of the broadcasts, tapes and LPs just as I had done with my old iMac (though monitoring required more cords in back--ugh!).For a committed neophyte like me, the UFO202 was probably sufficient.  I miss the permanently attached USB ""out"" cable and, moreover, am questioning whether I'll ever use the mixing capabilities of the 302USB, which to my eyes has a bit of a ""learning curve.""  The problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual.  Instead of separate sections, the manual uses small, thin font and mixes English with Spanish instructions--a minor but unnecessary inconvenience. (But give Behringer credit for providing a manual!)I thought I was investing in more versatility (for a modest price increase) than what the Behringer UFO/UCA line of interfaces offered me.  But a friend tells me that GarageBand has the capability of recording sound-on-sound.  My present programs (Sound Studio and Toast) can't do it, but if GB can layer 2 or more sound sources, then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better.  If not, the Behringer UFO202 is not only adequate to serve my needs, but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new iMac's desk space (Apple's elimination of the internal burner gives the company ""thin screen"" bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space--thanks to the new requirement of an external burner).Behringer has presented the best solution I've been able to find to Apple's surprising (and dubious) omissions with the latest iMac.  If your uses include mixing, and if you have the space (we're talking a mere inch or two), the 302USB is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks.  But if you have a UFO or UCA interface, your needs may already be covered."
1,4,"I bought the smaller Behringer 302usb mixer for a small home recording setup with a budget target of &#60;$125, but had to move up to this model for and additional cost of about $12 due to the fact that the 302usb doesn't provide adequate phantom power for a Condenser Microphone (not properly disclosed by the company). The simple setup I have also includes the Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Hosa XLR cable.I was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts, interviews, etc., over a simple USB headset, without &#34;breaking the bank&#34;. In addition to the positive reviews on Amazon about most of the Behringer equipment, my son, who has some experience with sound equipment said that Behringer makes solid items, but that I shouldn't expect much in the way of customer service. He's helped me work on tweaking my setup and he finds the items I bought to be quality as expected.I'm glad that I moved up to this board, even though it has a lot of features that I won't personally use. I'm glad that this has two microphone inputs, if I do decided to conduct in person interviews using the board. Besides the extra mic input, my son will likely put some of the additional features to use recording some music with his electric guitar and making some mixes using the features in GarageBand.I have found that my son's warning is somewhat correct, at least in regards to information provided for the customer by the company both in the paperwork included in the package and on the website. Since this is essentially entry level equipment, people like myself, who have little / no direct experience with sound equipment could use a little more guidance in using these projects, particularly in hooking things up to a computer, which is obviously an increasing application.I couldn't find any information on the Behringer website or in the paperwork which provided guidance for a Mac user, for instance. In addition, it would be nice if the manufacturer would give some basic information on such items as use of headphones for monitoring, etc. when using with a computer, but they don't. I've done a lot of experimentation in addition to Googling to figure out how to get things up and run.So far, I'm getting quality recording results from this board. I am currently using it with an RCA type cable with the input to my iMac's line-in. I might ultimately try another adapter for a USB connection or Firewire, but I haven't had the opportunity to research what is possible or which of the three options provide better sound. Whether I not I investigate will depend upon my needs in the future.I believe I got excellent value in the equipment quality. I would give 5 stars, but the manufacturer should provide more information."
1,4,"PROS:* Small. Easy to take with you or set on a small shelf.* If using USB, does not need external power supply.  Very convenient.* Easy-to-use, accessible controls.* Pre-amp power, works well with condenser studio mikes.* Plug & play with Windows 8.  Didn't have to install any kind of driver.* Variety of input options.  Dual track with low/high volume sliders.* LEDs make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range.  Easy to adjust.* Awesome for those who need a mini-mixer-- and costs the same as a USB-based preamp-only device.* Free shipping-- gotta like thatCONS:* Only one power setting, 15v. That may not be enough for some, but works great with my studio mike.* Line In / USB buttons somewhat confusing, non-intuitive.  However the manual shows exact settings for computer use.* As with other low-end Behringer mixers has a bit of a hiss that one has to balance out.  Can take some fiddling to overcome it.* It's pretty easy to overpower the computer's input and cause distortion.  Start the sound levels at zero and slowly bring them up until it sounds good.NOTES:I purchased this for use with my studio mike, which I hadn't been able to use with my computer due to pre-amp power needs.  Plugged it in, worked first time, no problems.This unit is very sensitive.  If used with a decent mike can pick up background noises from across a room.  With a bit of tweaking, is fine for studio work.  I use it for guitar/voice solo live Internet music shows.Overall, I'm quite pleased with the unit.  The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it isn't perfect... but then it's only fifty bucks.  For the price, overall quality, ease of setup, range, sensitivity and plug-and-play, I don't think one could find a better unit.  Two thumbs up.  I don't know how a Pro would rate this... but I definitely would recommend it to those doing recording on their computer with a studio-quality mike above the quality of the average ""USB microphones"" available on the market.  You not only get a pre-amp but a duo-channel stereo volume mixer in the deal.  Hard to beat at that price.ADDENDUM:  A few days after the initial review-- I just used the device on a live guitar/voice webcast.  No background hiss, very good, clear sound, crisp, no distortion, excellent transmission.  Friend recorded a video and the sound was precise and identical to the original performance.  Quite pleased with this little mixer/preamp.HINTS AND TIPS:Two good hints on this one:* Another user and I put our heads together and realized one can use a 6-volt lantern battery (or 3 to 4 AA cells), hook them into a USB printer cable and power this via battery.  It works great and makes this unit PORTABLE.* There are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the Windows handles sound. I have found this to be true. It pretty much takes over your entire sound system. For some folks this will be fine. For others, they may not appreciate this. So what I did was uninstall the drivers, remove it from the computer USB (which seems to defeat the purpose, but wait...)... and plugged it into one of those new portable-USB power supplies you plug right into the wall (they're available all over for between $5 and $10). This powers the system without hooking it into the USB system of your computer. What this does is allow you to use the functions of the mixer without altering how Windows handles sound, the programs it uses, or causing problems with programs like Audacity.You then run a LINE IN from your computer speaker output, a LINE OUT to your computer speakers or headphones, and you can still use microphones or whatever else you want. This is an excellent alternative to using it as a USB device. You are instead powering it from a USB wall-socket and simply using it as a quality mini-mixer (which function it performs very well). That's what I finally did and am still most happy with this device.In addition by using it in this manner you pretty much eliminate the relevance of what OS you use. You could use this with Windows, Mac, Linux or pretty much anything, because all you're really doing is setting it up as a mixer using standard line-in / out cables. Works very well in this capacity. Gotta love those new external USB power nodes. : )"
1,5,"Each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply.  Want a 5 channel system - buy 5 speakers and run xlr audio to each one.  No noise or hum.  Has both trs and xlr inputs - has a knob for gain control on back.  Most importantly each speaker has an IEC connector for power to JUST that speaker.  Mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using TRS outputs which copy the XLRs - those go to my Marantz PMD 580 digital recorder w/ 32 GB of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters.  Speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces.  There is, however, no mounting point - no captive nuts or such.You'll need to adopt a philosophy on gain.  You can crank the speaker gain to 100% and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the -15 to -6 dB0 range.  It may be a tad loud - in that case you may want to set both speakers to their 12 oclock position which is 50% power approximately.You could alternately use the mixer to run near 0 dB and turn it way down on the speakers.  I like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so I turn the volume way down but drive them with -6 dB0 off the mixer.Having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation.My **FIRST** nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have.  I will have to fabricate some protection.  My second nitpick is i owned the smaller m-audio 4"" monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i.e. not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer.  The speaker w/ 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it.  It was not the power supply as being on made the box warm, but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with -3dB0 into the trs line in.  Thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer!I do like this set of speakers.  From stereo to 5.1 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs.  I may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already."
1,5,"SOUND QUALITY: The BX5 sounds neutral and balanced. Compared to similar sized consumer speakers, they are a bit understated and without bass bloat or exaggerated highs (i.e., teen EQ). The even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours. It also lacks a midrange bump, and sounds a bit recessed or laid-back compared to average earbuds or home speakers. In fact the BX5 sounds similar to my Sennheiser 580HD headphones, but with less lower bass. And that's a good thing for mixing as you don't want speakers that add color and/or bumps in the frequency response.Unlike typical passive stereo speakers, the BX5 is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer, i.e., bi-amped. This design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver. The downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables, so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editing.At first the BX5 struck me as underpowered for a 70 watt rating, at least with a signal directly from my Mac Pro. However, once jacked into the hotter signal from my MOTU Ultralite the true power of the BX5 was revealed. It was loud and could be painfully so if cranked.These are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out (your head should form a triangle with the two speakers). That diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is MIA. In fact, unlike most speakers, there is little rearwards projection. Perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties. So don't buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use.I mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings, live and multitrack, so the bass range is perfect for me. The bass extends down to a clear 60Hz, so plenty ump for drop-D and drop-C tuning. If you mix bass guitar and kick drum you'll want larger speakers (BX8) or a sub but these are great for guitar.I'm used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass, mid and highs for different room responses and taste. Oddly, the PDF instructions show EQ switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers. I assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure.RFI RESISTANCE: I'm an inner city dweller and live in a high RFI area. Cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes. So one of the major selling points for me was M-Audio's claim of RFI shielding. Luckily that was no mere marketing jive. They really are well shielded against RFI. Not a single wayward drum loop or DJ in my tracks, not even when cranked. I can't make that claim for prior speakers I've owned.HEAT: These speakers run on the warm side: the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session. Not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips. It has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat. However I have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions. I live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up. Not a deal breaker but it's wise to turn them off when not in use (I use a power strip so I don't have to flip two separate switches).CONSTRUCTION: These are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way: the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed Cinema Display and MOTU Ultralite. Construction appears very good with dense particle board (MDF) cabs, metal back plate (heat sink benefit) and matching plastic front molding around the drivers. The cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl. These monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driver.The bass drivers are Kevlar with rubber surrounds (tougher than foam!) and the tweeters sport silk domes. No protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors. So the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick.CONNECTIONS: Like most studio monitors, the BX5 comes with pro audio style jacks for 1/4 inch phone plug/TRS and XLR. If you're a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use, be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks, RCA or USB. So you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters. If you're an experienced recordist, you should have plenty of these cables laying around but, otherwise, be prepared to reach for your wallet.One of the things I like about the BX5 is both the TRS and XLR connections are active at the same time, allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches. I have an Audioengine D1 DAC connected to the TRS/phone input (for iTunes, movies, games, etc.) while a MOTU Ultralite (for mixing & tracking) is plugged into the XLR connection.LAST BLURB: Yes, the small Focal speakers I listened to were better sounding and louder than the BX5 but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches. However, a perfect monitor for a home studio isn't only about a good neutral sound, but also about compactness, appearance and value. And the BX5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine."
1,5,"Arrived fast, had them up and running in minutes.  It was easy to adjust my EQ on my laptop to produce awesome listening music, just beautiful, clear, nicely separated sound.  I wouldn't use these for high volume stuff, the sound is almost delicate, and very precise in its separation.  The classical musician's in our guild loved the sound, that should tell you something.  Stunning, really.  They are, in fact, exactly what they are advertised to be - top notch small room project studio monitors.  I readjusted my EQ for the needed flat response for sound engineering and I was extremely pleased with the results.  The sound you can get out of these is so varied that we needed to give our hearing time to adjust, as the flat studio mixing EQ sounded horrible at first, as it should!  I have been in and out of studios for 30 years and I can say, used appropriately, these are excellent near-field mixing monitors.  Take time to review the set up data from M-Audio, its good stuff, and don't ask these little beauties to be everything, just let them be what they were made to be . . . and enjoy!  We ended up re-mixing half a dozen acoustical songs off a recent project with these via Cubase 7 and the general consensus is that the mixes improved by 30%."
1,5,"These dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me, as I am used to the normal dual cabinet, one amplified set up like the Behringer MS16 which I was trying to replace with these, but on second thought will set them up someplace else, as they do not have front controls, have only one trs or XLR connection point, require AC power for both, and as P Frary has stated are VERY dependent on input; they kind of worked with my Stanton S300, and not at all with my laptop.They are (as stated by other reviewers) very subtle, and may take some getting used to. Because of the dual amps, you don't hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet, as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit.I actually hooked one up like a guitar amp, and it worked fine; just a little guitar amp that sounded great.For your normal Stereo mini jack and RCA hook ups, I would go with the much lower priced MS16's which have multiple RCA jack in points, and one Stereo mini and full front controls.Addendum: 10/13I finally hit a home run with these speaker when I hooked them up to Sony CD changer unit I have for the living room, dialed in the speakers, and put them both on one on/off switch.  The soundis full, and fills the room."
1,5,"I'm used to the old 70's and 80's speakers that I've had on my stereo since that time.  I read the reviews about what people said about hearing things they never had before.  I was blown away.  They are all correct, get them setup right and hear all the things your music has been missing (I listen all the time with different headphones, not the same!).  The way the music was separated so well, I swear it sounded like the vocals were coming from right in front of me and the guitars were on each side of the vocals.  I had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out.  I don't know what kind of bass people are wanting out of these but when I use them to watch movies, listen to music, etc... They have lots of punch, even when I play my guitar through them (POD HD PRO)."
1,5,"As the reviews herein have indicated, there is a wide variety of uses for studio monitor like the M-Audio BX5.  With the proper cables, you can hook up everything from an iPad, to a home computer, to a musical instrument or stereo.  I will preface this review by saying that I am no &#34;audiophile&#34;.  I have a basic understanding of speaker and musical equipment, but my primary goal here was to find a small speaker that I could use to monitor guitar playing through either a preamp pedal or iPad modeling software.With those goals in mind, I was pleasantly surprised how good the BX5 sounded.  The goal of any &#34;studio monitor&#34; is to convey as much of the true sound of the source material as possible without coloring the tone with additional equalization.  There are some monitors in a comparable price range like the Rokkit 5 and options from Mackie and JBL - I have not tried those out.  But the BX5 performs we well or better than I hoped.For guitar playing, I use it in close proximity on a desktop.  I found that it had a surprising amount of low end punch for a 5&#34; woofer, given that my Fender tube amp has a speaker twice the size!  The bass is tight and articulate, which is what you want.  Again, if your goal is just to drown out the sound with additional base, go get a pair of Beats headphones or hook up a dozen subwoofers to it.  That wasn't really my goal.  But all that aside, having enough low end was important to me, and the BX5 delivers.  Using modeling of &#34;Fender&#34; and &#34;Vox&#34; type amplifiers, it also handled the high end &#34;chime&#34; well without sounding &#34;tinny&#34;.I should note that I got an XLR (microphone) cable that converts to TRS on the other side.  I had heard/read that this was the best way to get a guitar signal into the thing, though there are likely adapters and other cables you could use to accomplish the same thing.  There are both XLR and TRS inputs on the back.  The monitor is powered, so there's a power cable, as well.  There is a volume knob, but no independent bass/treble adjustment, as on other monitors.  So if you want that, look elsewhere, but if the monitor is actually relaying most of source tone, you shouldn't be using it anyway.  Really enjoying my BX5 so far, wish I had the budget/space for a 2nd one!"
0,3,"This is a pretty nifty item and it does just what it says very easily.  Get one of these and you'll soon have guitar picks coming out of your ears.  My only issue is that a pick punched from, say, an old credit card isn't going to replace my favorite picks.  It's a great idea, it's executed very well, no issues with the product itself, but I find that it's not incredibly useful to me.If you're not particularly picky (no pun intended) then one of these will supply you with picks for a lifetime."
1,5,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She thought it would be neat to make picks from different materials. She has used it many times using things such as old ID cards, plastic laminates, and expired credit cards. In all cases it cut a perfect guitar pick."
1,5,"As a guitarist, I lose and find picks everywhere. I hate buying them because I know they are somewhere in my house but I just can't find them. With this, I take all my old credit cards, student ID cards, playing cards, etc. and make my own. I now have an unlimited pick supply and they are all unique to me. It rocks, pun intended.Bottom Line: Every guitarist should have one. No excuses."
1,5,This is a wonderful item that really works! Arrived fast! Having a great time making picks out of old credit and gift cards! This makes a great gift item!
1,5,"I'm a pro musician and music teacher. These are the original pick punches, by the company from the guy who invented them... At least that's what it says on his website. The others are knockoffs.  They probably all work about the same, and they're all about the same price now, so why not support the dude who invented them. He's really into making picks, and has some pretty cool ideas and instructions on his website. I'm pretty crafty, and really like this. Bummed about rough edges? Buy a fine sanding sponge at any hardware store, sand the edges for a few seconds, and be done with it. He also sells sheets of plastic from his website, at quite good prices, and ink for stamping them. I got a cheap rubber stamp made with my URL for about $10 online, and make my own ""business card"" picks now. I also found some cool sheets of celluloid on eBay, it's not easy to find the right stuff but the picks I make now are just as good as any you would purchase, and the cost is way less for personalized pics anyway. If you need hundreds or thousands of picks made, well then you're better off ordering them, but I have fun making 10 or 20 of them at a time to hand out to potential students and clients. Oh yeah, I can still recycle old cards and stuff too, my students like bringing them in and making their own picks as well. Everybody knows that picks just evaporate when you lose them anyway, what could possibly be greener?"
1,5,"I've had one of these for about 2 years now.  I've made 100's of picks out of old credit cards, gift cards, club cards, plastic sheets, plastic packaging well you get the idea.  THis is fun and easy to do.  I have even sold the picks at garage sales (25 cents each).  My favorite cards to use are the iTunes gift cards (careful cause some of the iTunes cards are cardstock).  They most replicate a Fender Med. pick.  Most credit cards are a bit thicker (somewhere between a Fender Med. and Heavy).  THey work well also (the edges do come out a little rough but I use an old emery board to clean them up quickly and easily).  I use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results.  The best part is I am NEVER without a pick (even when people accidentally walk off with one.)  I do get funny looks at the stores when I ask for the used gift cards back (until I explain what I do with them- then the clerks are like &#34;wow thats so cool&#34;).  On average I can get 5 picks from a credit card (unless I'm going for a particular part of the card with a design on it).  It takes a little thought to get the most out of the cards- but seeing as they are basically free I don't mind &#34;wasting&#34; parts if I want a particular image.  Just a word of caution on things like DVDs or CDs- they are really too thick and tend to shatter- not worth the effort (I tried an old aol cd and only got one usable pick out of 8 punches)"
1,5,"This amazing punch can be used to completely obliterate the numbers, and name on an old card, and give guitar picks at the same time. The edges are a little rough, but it is a punch not a precision cutter. One of those soft nail sticks that the ladies carry around work very well to get the rough edges removed."
1,5,"When this little plastic gizmo arrived, I admit I had low expectations for it. At first it seemed a bit awkward to adjust on the neck and I figured the plastic would soon break. I really did not expect much accuracy in tuning, either.I have used this for a couple of months now, switching from electric to acoustic to classical guitars several times daily and am happy to report it works and works well.I may invest in one for each instrument and just leave it on the neck. Good product for guitar players out there who need a cheap but good tuner. It works as well as my expensive model I was using and I don't have to stick it on the guitar body. Worth checking out!"
1,4,"I have the older version of this as well this newer one.  The older one is more responsive to various instruments that can be hard to tune this way, like banjos, mandolins.  Sometimes this new one just won't &#34;hear&#34; the string being tuned unless it's 'encouraged'.  That wasn't the case with the first model.  It's not as completely accurate as some other headstock tuners but it will get your instrument quite close and then your ear should dictate.  The buttons can be easily confused until you are certain which one does what without looking at it. You could find the tuning being done several semi-tones below standard because you inadvertently touched one of the arrow buttons.  The older model has only two little buttons and not as many settings or choices.  And these won't clamp positively to some headstocks due to neck thickness at the nut, spacing between the tuners or the quantity of other things people want to clamp to the headstock.  But if you get it well clamped, it will stay there in the case or in use."
1,5,I have a vintage banjo with exquisite inlay and this tuner is almost invisible. It doesn't obscure the pearl inlay and works well as a tuner.
1,5,"You know, any time a company actually sticks a battery in the box with their product, it just puts a smile on my face. Planet Waves has not only made a great, small, easy to install and easy to use tuner, they included the battery. That's an A+ in my book.I've got a 12-string acoustic guitar. Pretty much every time I go to sit down and play, I would waste a good 5 minutes grabbing my old tuner, balancing it on my knee, and trying to tune up. With this head stock tuner sitting on the guitar, I just turn it on and quickly get in tune and down to the serious business of jamming. It truly makes the task many times easier. The display is easy to read. It's read when the string is way off and green when you're close, using lines on either side of the key/letter to indicate sharp or flat, or right smack dab in tune.If I had the money, I'd stick one of these on all my guitars. As it is, having it on my 12-string is going to save me hassle and time. This baby is worth every penny and I highly recommend it to any guitarist."
0,2,This is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there. I play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen. It worked but I don't use it anymore.
0,3,"I put this on my mandolin.  This does not work as well as some others I have tried, but the other one I was using broke very easily, so I looked for a different, more sturdy design.  This works OK.  Not the greatest, but OK."
1,4,"Broke one of my Snark tuners when I kept it on a guitar while putting it in the case to take to a gig and decided I needed a tuner I could keep on any guitar while it was in any case.Pros:- Fits on any guitar- ...which then fits in any case- Cheap- AccurateCons:- Calibration button and on/off button are same shape, same size, and on the same tiny surface. Very easy to hit the wrong one.- Not great (poor viewing angle) for 3-on-a-side tuners (works better for 6 in-line tuners)- Not as easy to read as the SnarkOther thoughts:I only use this on a guitar that I play for only one song at shows (because the song requires two capos and a detuned string, don't ask.) I much prefer the Snark, but apparently I can't be bothered to remember to remove a tuner before putting my toys away. Idiot. At shows I rely on a tu-2 stompbox for tuning. Basically, this is a niche tuner. It's so stinking small and that's what counts."
1,5,"This miniature tuner can be left attached discretely to a guitar headstock while playing. Just remember to turn it off, or the display will prove distracting. During winter when a guitar or mandolin &#34;moves&#34; with changes in humidity, staying in tune is an issue, even for expensive instruments. This little device helps the player deal with the problem without constant recourse to a larger tuner."
1,5,"item is really convienient. Small, unobtrusive size w/ good illumination for easy reading. I like the swivel design & swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want. Price can't be beat either."
1,5,Small... very small and sits right behind the headstock and very easy to see and READ. It is very accurate.  What else can I say except that this is a really great idea and it works!!!
1,5,"Works very well and is almost hidden on the guitar,  it is one of those things that once you have it the other ones that stick out seem poorly designed.  This one will stay on my guitar the others I always took off once it tune as they look so  awkward"
1,5,"This is another great product by D'Addario - I have used several tuners like the regular Snark (several versions), the Snark S1 Mini Clip (also known as 'Son of a Snark'), the Planet Waves Headstock Tuner, the Peterson SC-1 Strobo Tuner, the Korg HTB-1 and the Q7 Chromatic Headstock Tuner. This D'Addario Micro NS Tuner tops all those with ease. It is super easy to use and more precise than all the others (compared using several tuning computer softwares and the Korg Pitchblack floor pedal on my tests). The rotation feature is great and the visual metronome feature comes very handy, like when programming a delay pedal with more precision. The clip that holds the tuner to the guitar is very good, holds very well to your guitar headstock (doesn't matther the brand) and with stay snug there without damaging your guitar's finish. It is very light and you will hardly know it's there once playing - Highly recommended. Cheers!"
1,4,"I have used many clip-on guitar tuners. They are a wonderful innovation and certainly easier to use than the older rectangular chromatic tuners that do not attach to the instrument. One of my favorites has become the Planet Waves clip on. I have several of them and use them often on many guitars. Based on this experience, I was anticipating a better experience with this new Mini Headstock Tuner than I wound up getting.It tunes nicely and, so far as my ear is concerned, accurately. Others found it awkward to attach - I did not. It is small and unobtrusive but easy to read. Those are not problems. What is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device.This fragility is conspicuous in both the difficulty in removing the battery cover and, more importantly, in the too-delicate manual clamp used to fasten it onto an instrument.The fundamental issue is that in lieu of the spring clips that we used to attach other versions of the Planet Waves tuners to the guitars, this one has a basic manual expand and contract clamp. This clamp is made out of thin plastic, is difficult to adjust and I expect it to break after only a short time. Consequently, I cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the other.If the need is for a tuner that attaches to ONE instrument and will, essentially, live there, it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player. If you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument, you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clip-on versions of Planet Waves tuners.November 28,2011 UPDATEHaving used this tuner for a while now, I have found that it has a good purpose. While this tuned does have mobility issues as I initially noted, I have been surprised (and pleased)to realize that they are wonderful 'permanent' tuners for acoustic guitars! They are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible. I leave them on my 12-strings and one of the 6's. A non-built-in-built-in tuner at this price cannot be beat. Based on this belated realization, I have raised the product rating to 4-stars."
1,5,"When I got this I thought it was a cheap toy-like thing, but when I put it on my banjo, it perched on the head and was practically invisible to anybody else, but easy to see when I needed it.  It's red when out of tune and green when in tune.  It does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned.  I love it when I am the only one using it.  Unlike the clamp kind, like the Snark, it's hard to share.  The clamp seems flimsy and ratchets open and closed and takes a little getting used to, so between my husband and me using it, I'm afraid the thing will break.  I play the banjo and it fits nicely on the head, but my husband has to find a place at the end of his acoustical guitar for it."
0,3,"This is a decent to good little tuner, but there are some drawbacks to it.  Also, I have the otherPlanet Waves Chromatic Headstock Tunerto compare this one to.  Here are the pros and cons of this tuner as I see them:Pros:- Super compact.  Virtually invisible from the front of the guitar.- Adjustable frequency settings.- Top load battery.  No need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery.Cons:- Awkward in use when not used on a inline six tuning peg headstock.  I have a Gibson Les Paul and this tuner is awkward to use with it.- Less gradation in setting than other tuners.  The gradiation bars are thicker and fewer in number, giving less of a sense of how close you are to a perfect tuning.Debatable:- Clip mechanism: Not spring loaded.  This means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar.- One battery: This unit takes only one battery versus two with the other.When it boils down to it, I prefer my old planet waves tuner.  It seems more accurate to me with the finer gradations (though both units gave roughly the same results when tuning - using both at the same time) and I like the ability to clip it on and off in a hurry.  In fact I can easily recommend that tuner, main drawback is that that one eats batteries)This tuner is more catered to Fender-style headstocks for players that plan on leaving the tuner clipped on.  For those players, bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars.  For others, I highly recommend the other planets waves tuner linked to in this review."
1,5,"I have both this tuner and a Snark for each of my instruments.  Though I am not a professional musician, I find each them to be of equal accuracy.  In fact, the D'Addario's compact size and fit is totally un-noticeable and though its screen is micro in size, it is very clear and viewable denoting flat/sharp notation.  A great choice for the price."
1,5,"Disclaimers:1. Obtained free as part of Amazon's Vine program2. Tested on 4 ukuleles and one guitarSo, ukulele players: Yes, this tuner is for you.I tested this diminutive tuner on:- Sopranino (Ohana)- Soprano (Pono)- Concert (Kala)- 8-string Tenor (Pono)It's TINY so you can clip it to your favorite uke and leave it there.  It's a bit problematic on the Sopranino, as the tuner geta in the way if you try to clip it to the side, so it need to clip to the top.Tuning is easy.  Just pluck the string and the note letter appears on the screen. If it's red, you're off; if it's green, you're in tune.When you're off, little bars will display by the note letter: left if you're low, right if you're high. Tune in the direction needed until there's one bar on each side of the note and the note's name turns green. Quick and easy.I've compared this little guy to three other chromatic tuners and it's dead accurate.As others have noted, the only concern is around the little plastic latch that holds the tuner to the headstock.  But, it's held together fine so far and I've had it for weeks."
0,3,"As a musician I'm in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner.  I got the package of two.  Unfortunately, the first one died a quick and sudden death.  A new battery didn't resurrect it.  I couldn't find the other one, because they're small and black.  I finally did find it, and have used it several weeks on my Guild Acoustic, and it works nicely so far. In fact, it works really nice.  If you are concerned about stage appearance, this is virtually invisible to anyone watching or videotaping the gig, a plus because it's pretty small but big enough to read.  At the cheap price, it wasn't worth my time to try returning the first one.  I just decided to eat the loss.  I'm crossing my  fingers hoping this one will last.  If you are playing a really nice, (collectible) guitar, be cautious because these tuners, (and capos too,) can damage the finish permanently. I use a tuner on my Gibson Johnny Smith while I play but always take it off when I'm done playing."
1,4,"I wanted to use this thing for a while, before I reviewed it (I now own five of them).  When I compare it head to head (so to speak) with other tuners, even the ones built into my Ovation guitars, I find that this one has a little higher resolution.  That is, when the others say I'm good, this one says ""no, you need to go one tick more"".  That's not saying that it's inaccurate, it's saying that this one seems to dial you in just a little bit tighter than the others, but it still does it very quickly.  Since I never take it off of the guitar, I went ahead and trimmed off the little tabs on the front of the clamping mechanism, making it even more unobtrusive.  You can barely tell it's there from the front."
0,3,"The NS Mini chromatic headstock tuner quickly recognized twelve pitches across a multi-octave range of electric bass, guitar and mandolin. The accidentals appear as sharps or flats toggled using the alternate functions of the frequency button.The tuner's view window is slightly larger than a Chiclet but brightness and resolution are fine for dimly-lit spaces.  One thing that's less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself. If you've ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what I mean. I'd wager the back of most headstocks skew to lighter tones than darker, so if discretion is what the manufacturer is emphasizing, a lighter color may work better.The notes appear red when out of tune; their color changes to green as a `rough marker'.  You then continue fine tuning using the vertical bars that appear on both sides of the note.  They've gone to lengths to make the tuner stage-friendly, but I'd much prefer the green color mean ` fine tuned and done'.  That way I can look from a distance. I should only have to bother with the bars if I'm struggling to home in (and in my experience that's the exception rather than the rule and usually caused by: new strings, slack under the bridge pins, a slipping tuner, etc.  Mid-life strings tend to stretch and loosen predictably, so long as you don't use a lot of altered tunings.The NS is designed to be clipped discretely to your instrument headstock and viewed from the back. I'm a lefty and, unlike some other tuners, I appreciate the swiveling base that allows me to view the screen right-side up.The viewer doesn't extend far above the headstock surface and felt a bit cramped on my L4 with large New Yorker-style tuners.  On headstocks with more bare wood like a Strat, or even my A-style mandolin, it was easier to find a comfortable spot for viewing that didn't obstruct my hand while turning keys.At first I didn't like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock. I could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like I needed two to remove it: one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out. After a little practice, however, I found this wasn't the case and the touch required isn't difficult at all.The tuner's constructed in a high-impact composite, similar to those parachute-style clamps you see on backpacks. It feels durable and very unlikely to break, although I didn't try stomping on it.I was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag.  The battery door has a concave slot for easy opening with a pick or a coin. The tuner has an auto-shutoff function to preserve battery life.The power and frequency buttons are just nibs really; I'd prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them. The tuner can be calibrated in integer steps from 430 to 450 if 440 doesn't work for you.One advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and aren't limited to (usually) diatonic open strings.  For myself, I only use tuners to set the pitch of one string, usually the low A for guitar or bass and low G for mandolin. In my opinion, tuning a fretted instrument completely by open strings is only slightly better than tuning it completely with harmonics - and neither does the job well. Intonation is subject to a bunch of variables: string action and thickness, neck relief, fret condition, nut and bridge condition.Once I have a single string to pitch I match fretted and open string unisons and octaves. After a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument.I used to love staring at those Pignose-sized 'strob-a-tuners' sitting on amps and never faulted a musician who took their time to tune accurately (I wish many more did). I'm not quite sure how we went from, 'We tune because we care' to 'I'm so embarrassed to be standing here tuning I hope no one notices', but the NS Mini Headstock tuner - questionable design choices and all - does what it says with a minimum of fuss."
0,3,I want to like this more but it's not as good as my other tuners. Tuning calibration on the meter seems skittering to me making it a little difficult and not. As easy as the little round ones from Snark. I like those better and they're cheaper.
1,5,"I have bought several small tuners through the years, but this one has become a favorite. It is Tiny, but the screen is well lit and quite legible. It fits the headstock by pressing the ratcheted clip and releases by a small button on the front. There is a metronome function, which I haven't used. Simply strike a string. If it is out of tune you get a red light with flat or sharp bars. When the key is in tune, you will see a green indicator light and 1 bar on each side. I don't know how dependable and how long it will last since I have only had the two for about a month."
1,5,"I have another headstock tuner that I've had for awhile.  This Planet Waves PW is about the half the size and works just as well.  The clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky, but the tuner works like a champ.  Nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions.  Compared to my other tuner, it's rigt on the money.  The other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room, I don't have to take the tuner off."
1,5,"This little tuner is sweet! I put it on my strat-style guitar and it works brilliantly. Agree with another reviewer in that it would probably not work well on my Les Paul or Acoustics, but for the 6-in line guitars it's perfect. It is very precise and accurate, leading you to perfect tuning every use. I totally recommend this product - you won't be dissappointed."
1,5,I Normally use my KORG foot-switch tuner for my guitar and basses... this guy really had me believing in small-vibration-tuning.Three key words for this: Accurate + Small + InBeat!
1,4,"Ok, this is great for many reasons as most review will tell you and I have had no problems.  Cons: Minor one would be, that when mounted, the face of the tuner doesn't exactly face your eyes, you have to move your guitar a bit to aim it towards you. But the biggest CON is.... it's pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig. In sunlight, its TOO dim! ha ha!  At home or at a night gig its fine. Daylight? Forget it."
0,2,"Compared to the SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. The Snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. This works much better in that regard. This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine.  Tuning accuracy? Hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really. I prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the Snark. They are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. But this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.The negatives, and why I can't recommend it are as follows. The battery cover on mine fits very loosely. I worry the battery will fall out very easily. I may end up gluing it in place. It isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up I think).  The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways.  On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which string I'm plucking or tuning, but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow. I just can't for the life of me work out why they designed it this way."
1,5,"OK - I like this one a lot.  It stays on the instrument and allows for a quick tune up at anytime.  It is accurate, easy to see and use and does not get in the way while playing.  It sure beats the other units I have used where you clamp on some weird thing, tune up and then stash back in your gig bag.This one is... bing! - on, tune and back to playing.  It weighs next to nothing so you do not even notice it unless you are tuning up."
1,4,"First, I've noticed that many reviews here are for the ""original"" NS tuner, the one with only two buttons and ""coin slot"" battery cover. This one is a little smaller, has a metronome flasher, and the battery installs differently, but the name/model evidently didn't change.  I compared this new one, the ""original"", and the latest Snark on dreadnought guitar, mandolin, and 5-string banjo.Pros: Size, size, and SIZE!!Reasonably accurateMounting clip better than beforeGood priceMetronome flasher maybe for some?Cons:  Display not as bright as othersContrary to their description, this one seems less sensitive than original.Battery compartment difficult to openMay not fit well on some headstocks. On my wife's A style mandolin it fits but barely. On my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits.  That being said, I haven't found anything I can't use it on.My take.... The Snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy, lock in speed, and visibility however I really dislike the ""eyeball on a stick"" form factor and refuse to use it on stage!  I like the fact that the NS is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument, I even in leave 'em on in the case. The display and lock in speed of the original NS was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me. I'll keep the new NS tuners for now and hope that D'Adarrio (or someone) improves on it with a better processor and LED."
1,4,"I've been playing guitar more than 35 years and have used a lot of electronic tuners.  The first was slightly larger than a paperback book and cost what a cheap guitar sells for today.  But it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing.  Over the years tuners have gotten smaller, cheaper, and easier to use.  The Planet Waves PW-CT-12 is my new favorite.It is very small - a little bit larger than a grape.  Despite some of the other reviews I have used it with good results on a Strat, Tele, Les Paul, and ES-335 electrics and on acoustics from Martin, Gibson, National Resophonic, and Voyage Air.  I clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the low-E tuner.  I didn't expect it but it is out of the way enough to leave on while playing.  Previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock.  Small and accurate but to use it behind the headstock I have to read it upside down.  The PW-CT-12 is nicely out of the way even when I play an F chord with my thumb on the low E string.  It's so light I don't notice it's there.The display is bright and easy to see in most light.  A bit hard to read in direct sunlight but I do my best to avoid playing without shade anyway.  The display is small - a dime can cover most of it - but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position.  The '#' sharp symbol is small but once you are familiar with the display you recognize it.  (No flat symbol.  Bb is displayed as A#.)  The tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer.  The display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning.  It's red until you get close then green with a bar on each side when you are in tune (for example, |E|).  I found it to be stable enough to be easy to use for quick tune ups between songs.These are inexpensive and intended to be discrete so the clamp is small and thin.  Rough handling will probably break it.  I notice that the clamp is easily removed so I'm guessing Planet Waves may sell replacements.  The clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it.  It is a ratchet rather than a clamp.  You press a small tab and gently pull the clamp out then push it down on the guitar neck.  For this reason this is not a tuner to pass around.  It's meant to be left on an instrument.  (It's small enough that you can leave it on in the case.)  If you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better (and larger) choices.  It can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget.  I'm going to buy a couple more to leave on my most frequently used guitars.Other reviewers commented on accuracy.  If you want strobe accuracy there are better choices.  For that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display.  This tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary.  I haven't had a problem except with guitars that have built-in intonation problems (like old Nationals) and they need tweaking even after a Peterson Strobe.Soapbox: especially if you are a new player, do yourself a favor and learn to tune your guitar by ear!  Try tuning the strings to a reference pitch or each other then use the tuner to check.  Learning to tune by ear will help you in more ways than I have time to list.  Being able to hear the intervals in a chord and know which string is off is an invaluable skill.  People that can only tune with a tuner will take much longer to develop that, if ever."
0,3,"I thought to try this tuner after my gig bag decided to break my Snark SN-2's neck (fragile plastic socket of the ball & socket joint bent with stress). Functionally, I prefer the SN-2, which seems to do slightly more sample averaging while remaining responsive, displaying less &#34;bounciness.&#34; I also prefer the SN-2 display. However, there's *a lot* to be said about the small form factor, which I can leave on the headstock without risk of damage. Now I keep an NS on each of the mandolins that travel with me and I keep a Snark clipped to the music stand at home."
0,3,"It stays out of the way on my guitar, however, be aware that the mounting tab gets a little loose.  I am going to try glue to keep it holding its grip."
1,4,"I bought this tuner for my mandolin.  I have to play a little louder than I'd like for the tuner to hear me.  The display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays I've seen.  But it's so small that I never have to take it off, and it's doing its job well.  I'm pretty fond of this little guy."
1,4,"The Planet Waves tuner works effectively on acoustic and electric guitars, using the instruments vibrations to read pitch.  The tuner seems to be reasonably accurate, is lightweight, and is easy to read without being obtrusive to the audience.  It is also nice that such an inexpensive and small tuner can be adjusted to standards on either side of A-440.  Note that the photo of the tuner shows it on the headstock of a Fender-style electric guitar.  It works particularly well on the instrument shown because of the fact that the tuners are all on the same side of the headstock.  On something like a Gibson jazz guitar (ES-175, or one of the Epiphone or Ibanez clones, for example) it's more difficult to find an ideal place to attach the tuner.  Classical and acoustic steel-string guitars are also a tad problematic, too.  It's not that this tuner is unusable on other types of headstocks, it's just that the design limits where you can place it and still have it readable right-side up.  Some headstocks, too, may be too thick in order to attach this tuner.  As long as it fits on your guitar, the Planet Waves tuner is highly recommended."
1,5,"I primarily play live and I am a tone-o-holic. In other words, I use high end pedals, cables, amps and pickups and try to keep as little as possibel between my guitar and amp. I bought a couple of these so I could have one on both my main and backup guitar. No more need for a pedal based tuner. These work that well and are almost undetectable from the front. They also won't mark up your prized instrument."
1,4,"This tuner is tiny and works as advertised to tune my guitar, bass and banjo.  I have tested it against other, older and larger tuners and all tune to the same accuracy, which is very good.I docked it one star because the screen doesn't stay on (in my opinion) long enough when I am trying to tune a string.  When I pick a string, the screen flashed for a brief second with the tuning information and then goes blank.  It works, but I find other tuners easier to use that have screens that stay on longer with each pick.Perhaps a more experienced guitar play may only need that brief flash of tuning information to tune a screen, but for me I find it easier to have the tuning information displayed longer.Also this tuner is tiny.  I can leave it on my instrument when I put the instrument in a case, no problem at all.  The flip side of this is that the screen is tiny too.  Really tiny...almost hard to read tiny.  You need to decide if this tiny size is an advantage or disadvantage for you."
0,3,"This guy is great if you want to mount it on your guitar without a big clip-on gizmo that people see easily. Downside is that it is so small it's hard to tell what button you are pushing and it's not terribly easy to turn off and on (Do I push again? Push and hold?). Also, the screen to read if you are in tune is so small that sometimes judging how close you are to being in tune is hard. This being said, it's a nice tuner and stays on. Also, I should point out that while it does clip on, it's not as easy to move from one instrument to the other as some other tuners."
1,4,"One was Dead on Arrival, the other one works like a champ. I like the old version more. These are a little tricky to mount but do track well, and are not obnoxious looking like the Snark tuners."
0,1,"The device itself is difficult to read in bright light.My first one arrived not working at all.The second one arrived with a low battery. What? After three days the battery goes out.I would have returned it, but lost it because it doesn't adhere to the headstock very well. You've been warned."
1,5,"I have had plenty of these.  Lots just snap apart in the back, or don't even work properly when you try and tune them.  This one is spectacular.  It is real accurate, snaps on to the headstock perfectly.  Best I've ever found so far in a tuner."
0,3,"I bought the two pack and I've found them both to be a bit finicky. Sometimes they turn on right away and other times you have to click the button a couple times to get it to light up. When they're on and working they work well and I like the small size and tight profile against the headstock, I just wish they were a little more reliable."
1,4,"I purchased a couple sets of these to try them out.  They are small and unobtrusive digital tuners which can be left attached for easily keeping your instrument in tune.  They seem slower to lock then my Snark tuners, and the visual scale is not as precise, but they do seem to work fairly well.  The ratcheting mechanism holds tightly on my guitars, and they can be stored in the case attached.  Its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it.UPDATE:  Downgrading my rating by 1 star.  Having used four NS MicroTuners for a couple of weeks, on four different instruments, I have to say that, in comparison to my Snark tuners, the NS Micro Tuner is slow to lock, and difficult to tune precisely.  With the Snark (any of them...I have several models) I can usually pluck a string once and tune the string in seconds.  With the NS Microtuners, I have to repeatedly pluck a string, and the tuner is slow to display the adjustment.  Sometimes I have to pluck a string several times before the NS Microtuner acknowledges a string has been played at all!  It is also very difficult to get the tuning precisely on target. |E| would be a perfectly tuned ""E"", but one of the side indicators is always flickering and getting it perfect takes patience and repeated effort.  I still like having them clipped to an instrument for a quick check, but when I want to be precise (and fast) I always reach for the Snark."
0,3,"Seems like it draws current, even when it's OFF. I have two guitars, and this thing stays with one guitar. I make sure to turn this tuner OFF before putting the guitar away, and when I get around to playing the guitar again (7 to 10 days later), the battery is already drained. This happened at least three times already. The tuning is slightly off from an inline tuner that I have to compare against. I don't know which one is more accurate. The good thing is it's very convenient to have almost instant reading when you need it. I probably won't buy again for my other (and future) guitars."

0,3,"I tried this after I lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner. Not sure if I lost it at a gig, or my three-year-old son got his hands on it, I'd bet the latter.This micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini, which is nice. That's about the only Pro. There are a few other features I guess, like being able to select the instrument used, but I don't need that.Cons: The readout is smaller, duh, but does not seem to be as bright. I play a lot of outdoor weddings, in bright sun, and this one is much harder to read than the mini.This micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini. As you move closer to In tune, the bars do not smoothly move towards the center, so it's easy to over or under tune, and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done. And those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and you're trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect. I'm also trying to tune my semi-acoustic guitar as quietly as possible, so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option.Does it get the job done? Yes. But there is a product that's almost the same size that works a little better, for a negligible price difference. It might even be cheaper. If you're a beginner and want to select the instrument you're tuning and a few extra seconds isn't an issue, or you play in dark environments and don't need a super bright readout, this will be fine, but I will be going with the mini when I buy a new one."
1,4,"Update:  We received a replacement for this item. It does everything it was advertised to do, and it performs quite well, although the clip on the new one doesn't grip as well as the first.  The device tunes within 6/10ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner. Our thanks to D'Addario for their assistance in satisfying this customer!Please check our reviews.  We review regularly, and rarely have anything poor to say about products.Unfortunately, we cannot remain positive with this device.  Our small band keeps an average of 8 instrument tuners at the ready.  We have several NS1 models that work flawlessly, as well as TG-200 models that we really like.This one seems to consume coin-cell batteries at an unacceptable rate.  On average, it 'eats' a battery a day.  It also has a much darker display, making it hard to read unless the stage is quite dark.  One would think that if the display were darker, less power would be drawn from the battery.  Average room lighting is too bright to use this tuner.We do like the ability to rotate the display, so that the tuner can be mounted in front or behind the headstock, with the display maintaining proper orientation. Unfortunately the poor performance means that this unit will find its way into the junk-drawer on the workbench."
1,4,"I own several small tuners, including the Enote nano tuner and the Snark. In comparison to those, I would say its most like the Enote when it comes to size, but definitely more accurate and responsive.  In comparison to the Snark, its not as quick to respond but still does an adequate job tuning.  Its a great size and fits nicely in the pocket of a gig bag and isnt quite as large as the Snark. Anyway, it all comes down to preference I suppose.  I would recommend it."
1,5,"Use this on my Taylor acoustic-electric which does not have a built in tuner.  Love it - it hides very nicely on the headstock - your audience won't even see it.  What else can I say - it's accurate, it works, it clamps on really neatly & securely, it's a great price, it has not marred the finish on my Taylor's headstock in any way, etc....  I'd recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a built-in tuner.  Would definitely buy again !!!These are so cool that everyone should have at least one of these even if you don't need one  :)  !!!"
1,5,Yes!  I finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock!  It never needs to be removed!  It's accurate.  It's easy to use.  It's low-profile.  Highly recommended.
0,3,"I'll be upfront and honest right away and say that I'm not the biggest fan of headstock tuners.  I love the idea, but usually I feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired.  But when this popped up on my Vine newsletter I thought I'd give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things I don't like about the other ones (*COUGH*snark*COUGH*).A little background first, I guess.  I've been playing guitar for the last 9 years, and I currently have two other tuners.  I have a little Korg plug in type,  where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up.  I also have a Boss TU-3 pedal tuner.  If I'm jamming with friends or playing a show, the TU-3 is what I'll use to stay in tune.  Its very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal, so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience.  For home practice I use the Korg, as I usually tune up before I start playing, then just plug into my practice amp and blast away.  The Korg is nice and accurate, easy enough to use for alternate tunings, and in 9 years of having it around (including in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU-3) I've only had to buy one replacement.I first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue Snark that everyone seems to have these days.  He was not incredibly pleased with it.  Not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn't exatly easy to tune up with it.  While I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something I'd want on my headstock.Enter this Mini Headstock Tuner by Planet Waves.  Does it fix the problems that made the Snark so unappealing to my friend and me?1.  Accuracy:  It does seem to tune accurately, that's a good thing, and it already puts this ahead of the Snark.  Its not easy to use for alternate tunings however, so do keep that in mind.  Also, the letters take some getting used to, as they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players.  Not a huge complaint, but it isn't as idiot proof as my Korg or TU-3.2.  Looks/Ease Of Use:  It's quite a bit more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstock, which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar.  The only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side, you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen.  My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock.  I wear my guitar fairly low, so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down, but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck.  Those with Fender style headstocks should have no problem, though, it'll work great for them.  Also, it is plenty bright, so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue.3.  Durability:  This is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are.  The Snark is very easy to break, as it rests on a small ball joint.  This Planet Waves mini isn't going to lose its head too easy, but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold up under too much use.  The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too, so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy enough to break.  I haven't had it long enough for this to happen yet, so I can only give you my initial impressions.  Let's just say this, I'd never gig with this guy as my only tuner.  Its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use.All in all, it is a better headstock choice than the Snark.  However, headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they're gonna work for everyone.  Anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest a Boss TU-2 or TU-3 or a Korg Pitchblack).  I know they're more expensive, but you'll be happier off in the long run.  Those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session, this is a nice option.  But it may not hold up forever.I'll probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug in, but as headstock tuners go, this is nicer than most."
1,5,This little tuner is excellent. Very accurate. I love it. I have other tuners but this one is the best. I didn't realize it was so small. I was concerned when I first open the package because of it's size. But this mini tuner is just plain amazing. I'm glad I bought it.
1,4,"This tuner is tiny and accurate. Initially, the instructions were somewhat puzzling to me because there were no diagrams next to the instructions. For example, the instructions read, ""Press the tuner's release lever to open the tuners ratchet clamp."" Uh, ok. I had to play around with the tuner to figure out how the lever and ratchet clamp worked. After I figured it out, I'd have to say that I don't like this mechanism. I prefer the ease of the spring loaded clamp. But I do like the rotation of the display. As for tuning, I had difficulty tuning the low E string on my travel-sized guitar. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the display jumps around a lot even with the ""tip"" of plucking the string with a light to moderate stroke. For my full-sized guitar, the tuning was easier, but I had some difficulty on the low E string. Tuning my concert ukulele was relatively easy except for tuning the E string again proved to be more effort. Just for fun, I tuned a full-sized cello with great results, but there was no easy way to clamp the tuner on. Another experiment I ran was checking out the tuner in a room with another instrument playing. After tuning the instruments, I checked the tuning against another tuner and the mini tuner was spot on. Although concealing the tuner from my audience isn't a concern of mine, I would definitely recommend this tuner to someone with that concern. Otherwise, the clamping mechanism is more of an issue for me."
1,4,"After years of having a large, awkward tuner I was thrilled to learn about this modest little clip on. So much more discreet to do a little last minute tune up when you're already on the stage.I love that the lights are bright and easy to see, unlike one previous tuner I had that was very hard to read. Dark grey letters on a light grey screen. Even better is that the light colors are different for flat, sharp and on-tune which makes it even easier. May not seem like a big deal when you're tuning alone at your house, but when you're on a stage with other people doing a lot of last minute adjustments and your attention is all over the place, those little details really help.The only real drawback I see in the design is that there is no place on the head of my 6 string acoustic where I can conveniently clip this without it being somewhat in the way of the tuning knobs. Not impossible, but not terribly convenient, either. It was seemingly designed with an electric style in mind where the knobs are more often in one straight line than on either side of the guitar head.The $80 tuner I bought 20 years ago is a Sabine, and quite frankly, 20 years later it still works as well as it did when I bought it. In fact, the price has come down and I bought another one to keep in a different guitar case. Now that I have this one I still use the Sabine more at home, but like this one better on stage because it's low profile. Looks more professional and I like that."
1,5,This unit is very small and tucks away nicely.  It is easy to use.  I do wish they would make the bracket a little stronger but it works well.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Very Nice!!
1,5,"First it tunes very accurately. Second its low profile, I keep it tucked under the head stock, the crowd can't really see and I it is completely usable if I need to quickly tune during the set and my ears aren't cutting it.  Third, buy it if you are looking for a new tuner."
1,5,"I really like this tuner.  I have always liked the Planet Waves tuners for ease of use and accuracy.  This mini tuner takes all I like about the larger Planet Waves model and makes it ultra compact.  It fits nicely on smaller intstruments such as mandolin and any instrument with headstocks that don't readily accept the larger tuners (banjo, Telecaster etc.).  I currently have 2 of these and find them very reliable and accurate.  Easy to read.  Easy to see.Another winner from Planet Waves.  (almost forgot to mention one other thing that is nice about this tuner is its stealth ... it can hide behind the headstock so you won't be concerned with it being always clipped on and it won't interfere with the look of your instrument)."
1,5,"Cool little digital tuner  that works great on my ukulele. Small and unobtrusive, unlike my other digital tuners.  I like the backlit display with simple markings that make easy to tell if you are in tune with a quick glance.  Highly recommended."
1,5,Very cool little product for those of us who cannot tune by ear yet and don't want to wander around looking for our tuner that we can never find.
1,5,"I ordered this because I have an Ovation, and none of the clip on tuners were able to get a good grip on that kind of headstock.Due to the small size and adjustable clip, this tuner fit perfectly, and well out of the way. It took me a few tries to get used to pushing up on the ON/OFF button, but no problem now.As a tuner, I really like it. The small green screen is easy to read in low or regular light (haven't tried it in bright light yet), the bars for fine tuning are pretty stable, and it did a great job in a noisy gig, where I changed tunings about 10 times during the evening."
0,3,"This is a product that is unique, tiny and would be very useful-- if it were more accurate.  The problem is it's just not responsive enough.  To get it to work one has to place it low on the headpiece (next to the nut) and strum a string pretty loud for a consistent register.  Placing it at the top of the headpiece it simply doesn't pick up enough string vibration to register well.The problem with placing it next to the nut is that it then makes it impossible to hang the guitar on a wall-mount guitar hanger.  That may seem like a small issue... but not if you use such a device regularly (as many home-players do).  Myself, I have 5 guitars hanging on my living room wall.That doesn't make this valueless.  You can always clip it on the top of the headpiece and then move it when you're ready to tune.  Thus I give it 3 stars.  However there are other more responsive tuners, such as the capo-tuners we've seen on Amazon lately.  They're about the same price (actually, the capo tuners are a bit less-expensive) but I've found the capo-tuners to be considerably more responsive.So bottom line, I'm not impressed.  These aren't an expensive tuner comparatively speaking, and that's good.  But they' really don't do all that great a job.  They're unresponsive enough that I honestly think a person might break a string before realizing the tuner isn't responding to the current string pluck.Note to Ovation guitar players:  this is not the clip-on tuner for you.  There's simply no place to clip it.  Fortunately my Ovation has built-in tuning, but if you have an Ovation Acoustic, you'll want a different tuner."
1,5,"I just put thePlanet Waves PW-CT-12 NS Mini Headstock Tuneron my Stratocaster last night. It replaces several other tuners I have been using that hung off the headstock and tended to come loose and fall off or had to be constantly re-secured and positioned (and removed/re-attached when I transferred my guitar to/from the case). The mini takes care of all those problems -- I attached it between the low E and A string tuners, inner facing with the display rotated to face me. It is sensitive and accurate. The display is quite readable, even without glasses and features a color change to green when near or in tune. There are fine tuning bars on either side of the note indicator so you know when you are right on. I can leave it attached when I case my guitar which is a huge plus. The battery is top loading so I don't even have to remove it to change the battery, which probably won't be for a while since it has an effective auto-shutoff function (as opposed to other tuners I've used that are supposed to shut-off when no audio energy present but don't and kill the battery). Also the display is smaller and as such, probably requires less power to operate which translates to longer battery life. It can be turned on (or manually turned off) with a simple touch of an easily palpated power button. The frequency is adjustable +/- 10 hz from 440 if you need that for some reason. It uses a clip to attach via friction, which is adjustable and the clip is padded so it won't scratch the finish of the headstock. I am so happy with this tuner I am buying TWO MORE immediately, one for my Breedlove acoustic, another to keep as a spare. Every once in a while I happen across products designed to fill a specific niche that fill their designated need perfectly and this is one of them."
1,4,Beware! This tuner works by guitar vibration. If your playing loud with other people you'll have to ask them to stop playing so you can tune. Not recommended for band environments. Probably ok for solo gigs or home practice. Otherwise its very stealth and easily clips on most guitars.
1,5,Easily installed on my parlor guitar. The oval shape helps retain the strap and looks kewl. Installation is not rocket science.
1,5,"These end pins are so simple and logical that I'm surprised it's taken the design process this long to get to this point. I used to use Schaller straplocks but they're not compatible with all straps. If the end leather/material is too thick, the lock won't fit. I enjoy the elliptical endpin design, as it helps me feel confident the strap will stay on, but I can easily remove the strap or use another on the guitar. I highly recommend you try this out if you're looking for a great way to keep your strap secured."
1,5,"If you are looking to install a guitar strap button or just want to upgrade your existing button, these are great buttons to use.  It comes with two buttons, two washers and 4 screws (two different sizes)."
1,4,"Item came with two sets of screws, a long set and a shorter set. Looks good on my Yamaha acoustic guitar. Holds my strap well. I am happy I bought this."
1,5,"I must first state for the record, I hate strap locks. Hate may be a bit shy of the mark, actually. I've never met a set I liked in any single way.  I've only ever dropped an instrument that HAD strap locks on it. In fact, EVERY instrument I've owned with strap locks has suffered a gravity attack caused by the very device intended to prevent such misfortune. Schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed- even with Locktite. When you install them, you are compressing the nut and washer against a compressible material (leather, nylon, etc), so it is never really tight. Plus there's only about two threads on the slim little nut, and if they aren't a really tight match to the other half, wear very quickly (especially since you have to tighten them so often). Duncan type often suffer from 'non-positive lock syndrome' if not regularly cleaned and lubed. Then there's the fact that unless all of your instruments are equipped with the same brand of lock buttons, your strap is only compatible with the ones which match. And then there is the the metal-on-metal clankyness. Yuck. Oh, and and the cost. Moving on.Why are these little Elliptical End Pins so brilliant? They are NOT strap locks. If you orient the widest points horizontally when you install them - as you should, then in order to put your strap on and take it off, you will need to turn the strap 90 degrees to the instrument. This isn't something you are likely to do inadvertently while reaching for your beer onstage. Sometimes the simplest design is the best design. And they're pretty, too.Downsides? I will say the screws supplied with these are pretty short, but then I would also argue there is no reason to not use the screws holding in the original strap buttons as long as they fit tightly. If they don't, using smaller or shorter screws is not the answer- especially considering if the screws cut new threads, you're pretty much- uh, screwed. The washers these come with are pretty small too, so I just used the screws and felt washers that came with the factory buttons. With a brand new strap, they can be a bit tricky to get on, but just as tricky to get off (which is good). That tight fit could cause some increased wear on the strap, especially if it is made from cheap materials. With older straps, just as with any traditional strap button, you need to develop a good habit of always checking the positive seat of the strap, but it is very easy to verify, and again much less likely to slip than a traditional button. Mechanical strap locks actually require just as much diligence to ensure they are still securely fastened and working properly. But with strap locks, if there's a problem, you'll have to grab some tools to fix it - or replace it entirely. Talk about a false sense of security. With PE's Elliptical End Pins, you just put the strap where it should be and you're set.If you are one who is taken to doing back-flips, or find yourself frequently using your strapped instrument like a hula-hoop onstage, then these probably won't save your precious instrument from the gravity goblin or inertia monkey's worst intentions. But if either of these antics are your norm, you might be better served by a permanently attached strap, or perhaps therapy.Since writing the review above, I've ordered several more sets to use on all of my basses. I'm done with traditional strap buttons and don't imagine ever going back to metal on metal strap locks."
1,5,"These strap pins are fantastic. They securely hold the strap on your guitar very nicely. The oval shape is perfect. There is no need for proprietary or expensive ""strap locks"". They are easy to install. These elliptical pins are great. Terrific yet simple concept. They also look great! I highly recommend these to anyone who has a guitar. I will never use strap locks again after trying these. Great value."
1,5,"I was looking for a strap locking designed button for my acoustic guitar. These work great and look sweet too. Their shape keeps your guitar securely in place, but is also easy to unhook when your ready. High quality product and very easy to install. Just what I wanted."
1,5,"Brilliant solution to the strap button problem! The pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it won't slip off! Works as well as locking strap buttons did, for me."
1,5,I like these little guys. I'm not a big fan of strap locks and these provide more security than a traditional circular end pin at a great price.
0,3,"It works and cleans the strings, but its durability is a little low, for about 2 months. I recommend Planet Waves String Cleaner if you plan to use a really good cleaner."
1,5,"This has been a very good purchase, I have not stopped using it since I got it, good and prompt service as well Thanks again Cheers !!!"
1,4,bought because cheap and trying to keep my electric guitar strings in good shape if I decide to pick it up again.
1,4,Used on my acoustic guitar.Pro:Removes friction for faster playing. I noticed immediate result after applying first time.Enhances string life and tone. Strings sound brighter now. I guess there was some mild crud buildup you can't see.Reduces finger noise. Not completely gone but lessened.Easy to use applicator. Wide applicator makes it easy to put on and not get it onto the fret board.Con:Packaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks. Has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesn't prevent dry out.I don't believe I would buy again until a sealed container is provided.
1,5,"I have tried many string cleaners and so far this one is as good as any.  I like the applicator, and will just need to see how long it lasts."
1,5,"The perfect wall mount for a ukulele. My daughter loves it. Instrument looks great on her wall, and it is easier than taking out of a case to practice. Installs in 5 minutes with included drywall anchors and screws (or mount to wall studs)."
1,5,I don't know why others rated it as a 4 star.  It is exactly what it says it is and works fine.
1,5,"I'm a guitar player who owns several electric and acoustic guitars.  I learned a long time ago that guitar-like instruments ought to  be hung by the neck, as one finds them in a music store, to minimize neck warpage, and all my instruments are hung.  This is probably not so important for something as lightweight as a ukulele, but I also thought the instrument would double as wall art.So when my wife unexpectedly brought me back a nice electric-acoustic uke from Hawaii, I immediately went shopping for a wall hanger.  There are more expensive ones out there, but this wooden String Swing turned out to be perfect.  Easy to install, holds the uke perfectly, and the whole thing looks great on the wall.  Call me a satisfied customer.JM Tepper"
0,3,"While this hanger is not unattractive, and is well built I could and will modify it to better suit my needs.  The design of the hanger causes the neck of the &#34;uke&#34; to stand off of the wall 2+ inches at the head and 3-1/2 inches at the hanger itself and 3 inches at the base of the body.  This is not an easy fix but it is doable."
1,5,"Just like the ones in the store.  We mounted our two ukes on these.  Put our hangers in studs, but they come with those plastic gizmos for drywall.  Heavy duty and nice looking.  Great price.  You just can't beat the speed and convenience of Amazon."
1,4,"Great deal for the price. Works fine, but like all cheap pickups it basically makes my acoustic sound like a clean electric. Did the job for what I needed. Now I know I would love a better one like a Fishman."
1,5,this pickup for the price is just as good as one that cost 4 tom 5 times as muchif your looking for one that wont break your bank but sounds good this is the one
1,4,"If you're the kind of player that 'beats' on an acoustic like I do you'll find the sound hole pickup is an obstruction that you're constantly picking against causing loud clicks, pops and bangs.Very accurate pickup otherwise"
1,5,"Very handy,  I just slip this into the sound hole, hook it up to my amp, and then, when I finish playing, I slip it back out.  This is handy when I practice at night when my wife is sleeping."
1,5,"It works very well, installs easily, stays in place once installed but can be removed easily.  Does not scratch guitar's finish (just be careful, and no issues).  It will not produce the sound of a unit that is built into a guitar, but it comes very close.  A great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric."
1,4,when it works good its great but sometimes it gets static-y I wish it had a volume in line not much more to say
1,5,This pickup is actually a really great product for what it is! I hooked it up to my acoustic and plugged it into my line 6 amp and shredded a little bit.It's NUTS being able to rock out on my amp with an acoustic!!!!
1,4,This is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric.  I did find out there may be a little feed back from the amp if you get too close.
1,4,"A couple of my friends and I own this pickup and use it to amplify our acoustic guitars through a mixer and loudspeaker system.  Works really well considering how inexpensive it is.  It's very easy to install and remove, but be sure you have a fairly standard-sized sound hole in your guitar to ensure that it will fit and be reasonably stable."
1,4,"I had just bought an electric acoustic and while I was ordering that I just went ahead and picked one of these up as well because I figured what the heck it's under $20 and maybe my full size acoustic might work well with it. So I got it and th only thing I had an issue with is that it slide around a little too easily, but, it does work well. I recommend it for those who are looking for a simple solution to making their acoustic, electric so that they can play it through their amp."
1,4,"Very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound.Very high gain,fits in all size soundholes.Good heavy construction.Of course it's not great.I'm not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself.If you have a Taylor, Martin or Gibson that's not already AE this is not for you & I probably didn't even need to say that!!I just have a cheep Rogue that sounds good with this pickup.It's just a matter of how much you want to (or can) spend.I'm happy with this pickup!!Joe"
1,5,I purchased this to use until I get the replacement to my Ovation CC28 and it is load and clean. For $20.00 it is worth all day.
1,5,"I've used my HDE pickup for about a month now. I use it with a Fender Frontman amp. The sound quality is as good as pickups of twice the cost. I highly recommend this product. I'll probably get a second one for a backup, while I can get it at the present price."
0,3,Low strings do not get picked up very well but is ok if you are just strumming. For the price it is a good deal.
1,5,I was apprehensive about ordering this pickup but am so glad I did!! I am now able to play/ record my acoustic through my effects processor and play it through my amplifiers. Does an awesome job of reproducing your acoustics sound. I recommend this to anyone looking to amplify the sound of their acoustic guitar!!
1,5,"Have used them for years, bought some new guitars, had to have.  Wish they had something for Acoustic Electric 1/4&#34; backplug"
1,5,These on my guitar as a replacement to some old ones and they work well.  I have had no problems with them.
1,5,I put them on a Dipinto Mach V with that Levis Rat fink guitar strap I need to exchange. I use this on all my guitars. I tried some off brands and I've found it worth the extra few dollars to get the real deal.
1,5,"About ten years ago, I installed strap locks on my first guitar (Fender Stratocaster). They worked well and were easy to install. I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results: the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation. I had to drill additional holes no two guitars (Gibson SGs). Ouch.This made me take a second look at Schaller. The components, beginning with the screws, are of much higher quality than Dunlop. It took me ten years to realize that I made the wrong choice. I should have gone with Schaller from the beginning. I have replaced all my strap locks with Schaller with excellent results."
1,4,"I just bought a Rickenbacker 4003 that came with Schaller strap locks pre-installed.  I've used Dunlops before, but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass, so I just bought the Schaller buttons.  I don't quite like their look as well as the large round Dunlops, but there's no question about the quality -- these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon."
1,4,"Sounds great, easy to adjust.  Nice shape to help fit it on a compact pedal board. Worth price hands down."
1,4,"This is a very basic delay pedal, with the obvious knobs: delay volume, time and repeats. It has a nice bright sound, never too muddy and it's perfect for some Dave Gilmour style slap back delays.It only works with a power adapter, no battery. This has its pros and cons: on one side the pedal has a smaller foot print and costs less, on the other side if your power adapter breaks you're out of luck!Unlike many similar pedals this one doesn't let you set infinite repeats: this makes it impossible to make tricks a la Johnny Greenwood like creating quick loops and changing the delay speed to obtain weird noises. This is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals, so I returned it. Nonetheless, the product itself is great: cheap, sturdy and it does exactly what it's supposed to do."
1,5,does a good job for a basic delay...good for rockabilly and 50's slap echo. I needed it for nothing else so I'm happy. :)
1,5,Great pedal.  Get it. You wont be disappointed for basic delay needs.  Great tone.  Dont waste your $$ on others with similar specs.
1,4,"Just got it, so far so good. I use delay pretty light n tight - slapback vibe, not too wet. This does it well. I considered the MXR delay - no - I may have considered it but the only pedal failure I've ever experienced was my MXR/Dunlop Phase 90, first the DC input, then the stomp switch, after light/barely any bedroom use. This ModTone here, seems solidly constructed. I haven't played with it too much yet, but as of right now, I wouldn't recommend it for Edge wannabes, seems limited in that regard. I may be wrong, but either way, do we need more Edge wannabes?No, we do not.Good tone though, does the trick, trick."
1,5,"Good design, easy to hang on to these picks.  Reasonable price makes it even better.  I don't often use picks, but when I do, I use these.  I will buy more in the future."
1,5,"I collect picks (or plectrums if you're a purist) and that's because I'm trying to see how & where I can use a new pick. My first pick was a shark fin and I loved all of the ways you could hit the strings with those picks. Now we have the BEEHOLD picks.What I like about this pick is the 'stinger' or the longer point to hit the strings with. Sure the octagon hole in the center makes it less of a challenge to hold on to but that's not been much of a hindrance to me. Rather this pick's design makes it easier for my holding hand to hit the strings without my palm's fleshy part accidentally touching the strings.I found running leads & scales with this pick to be a delight! I like heavier picks so I chose the 1.00 mm as that was the size I started off with from my first guitar teacher who recommended heavy picks. I've found this pick to be great for strumming & rhythm patterns equally as well as for serious lead playing.Another thing is that with the design, I've found that I need not squeeze this pick as hard as I have to like I do with a Tortex pick and that makes playing so much more fun.Overall I give this pick 5 out of 5 stars & will be using these for many years to come."
1,5,"I like this pick ,the hole helps from the pick sliding on your fingers , its not soft or to hard of a pick ,,I like it,"
1,4,"Bought this pick looking for options around the old ""dropped pick"" syndrome. I was skeptical, as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most. However, once between thumb and index finger, these darlings hang on!"
1,4,"Not my favorite pick but pretty close, they are solid and haven't dropped one yet..I wish someone would make a grippy texture pick with a hole in it too..."
1,5,"I have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus. I have several bad habits, including a tendency to need to grip the pick too tightly or I drop it at some point. On a bit of a lark I bought a pack of the Clayton BeeHolds (0.5mm,) and really like them. The hexagonal hole really does make them stay in place with much less grip required, and I find the hole to be in a very natural-feeling spot. The pick is fairly long, but I have not had any accuracy problems with them, and so far durability has been good.I still use other picks too, but I really like these and can't imagine not keeping an ample supply on hand."
0,3,"I wanted to try the Clayton Beehold picks to see if the hole would help me grip the pick better so that it doesn't rotate in my hand.The .80 pick is a little too heavy for my style of playing but the hole is a neat idea and did seem to help a bit, but I gave up on the pick pretty quickly due to the stiffness."
1,4,"This holder grips the IPad tightly so a sudden fall is not an issue.  The rotation to vertical is good but it would be nice if it went both left or right.  Because the arms don't collapse it's a bit bulky to transport in a gear bag but its positive clamping offsets that issue. I've seen some with folding arms that have dropped IPads suddenly because something came loose.  Where I fell down was not ordering the K and M clamp arm that comes as a package under a different order number.  I've since seen that arm in use and it would improve the versatility of this unit, though the package is pretty spendy. I could not order that arm separately.  I mounted this holder onto a short mic stand by using two mic stand quick releases - one for the holder and one for the mic stand boom arm. Then the whole thing breaks down quickly to stuff into a bag."
0,3,"It is well made and is very safe unless a drunk drummer knocks over your stand. I would prefer more tilt, but it serves the purpose. It's Also harder to use your iPad without holding it and having an arm rest. Very durable and light weight. If I had to do it over again, I would use a music stand instead. Someday I may use it on stage. It's made in Germany, so it could be taken into battle."
1,5,My ipad lives on this thing!  I might be considered the laziest person around but I use a mic stand to place my ipad over my head so I can watch movies in bed while laying down.  I sometimes feel like I'm in a spaceship when I go to interact with my ipad.  I do wish it could rotate both directions.  It only goes from hamburger style to hotdog style by way of a right turn which is great if the stand sits on the right side of the bed.  But if you sleep on the left you're gonna have a bad time...
1,5,"This holder is rigid, well built, rugged and works great at what it does...holding my iPad2.  I play guitar and like to use my tuner app and scale app, metronome and other apps and having this hold my iPad so I can adjust it and see it clearly where I want it is nice.  Great product, highly recommend."
1,5,"I had been using a regular music stand for my ipad but our stage is a little bouncy, so i wanted something that would grip the iPad.  this stand does the trick.  I don't have to worry anymore about my iPad falling off of the stand.  Some people have said that it's not as safe when you rotate it to the portrait position.  I have not found that to be true.  Since I've had the stand, I have never droped the iPad out of it.  A lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic.  Because of the way that I stand with my guitar, it's hard for me to see the thing when I use the clamp kind.  This one uses the Mic clip treads and because it's on it's own stand, I can put it anywhere, at any height and see the iPad.  The only drawback is, you can't have your iPad in a case.  Or you have to find a case that's ultra thin.  Otherwise it's great!"
1,5,"This Review is for the (JOYO CRUNCH DISTORTION)  I have a few OD's including a OCD, a fuzz and a modded Rat but thought for $30 bucks from Crazy Cart this might be a cool distortion pedal. And it is. It's very articulate and gives you good Marshally 70s/80s crunch. Cleans up nice with the guitars volume and retains your guitars sound. It's almost OD-ish in it's responsiveness. It's not super heavy distortion though. I'm a blues/classic rock guy and it'll do fine for heavy, classic rock distortion but it's not a modern metal pedal. For the price its amazing. I really love it. I'm so impressed with this pedal that I've ordered the Sweet Baby and will probably get a couple of others while they're still cheap."
1,5,This is supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box.  I can not comment on this as I have never played this pedal.  What I can say however with 30 years playing experience is that this is a very good pedal.  When one takes into account the price it is a great pedal.  I own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo.  This has the most distortion.  It has a nice ragged edge to it and is great for classic to hard rock.  It does have a bit of noise at high gain but much less than the boss stuff I have had experience with. It is solidly built and apprears road worthy.  great pedal and great value. I would have no hesitation buying this or any other joyo product
1,4,"Great clone of a much more expensive Crunch Box pedal.  True bypass.  Knobs and switch are sturdy.  Great for amps that have only a master volume and no gain knob because you can dial in the dirt at bedroom levels.  This is a Marshall type distortion (more mids, less scooped).  No Brutalzzz - there are better pedals to cop the scooped 5150 or triple rectofier kachunky palm muting downtuned type thing, but you can get close with the right amp EQ and this thing dimed.  I agree with another reviewer- this thing has a very high output- so be forewarned the first time you plug in.  Unity is around 8 o'clock on the level knob.  It gets thumbs up for the sound/price ratio.  If you don't mind a longer shipping time, these pedals can be found more cheaply by searching the web.  This was my fourth Joyo pedal and I believe Joyo and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the better deals going these days in terms of price/quality."
1,5,"This Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion pedal is just amazing! My son has become a fairly decent guitar player over the past year and is moving beyond the basics, so was thrilled to get his hands on this distortion pedal. It was great to hear him play ""Iron Man"" through this pedal, it made a huge difference.The pedal produces a rich sound that has a nice sustain and tweaks easily with the three adjustment knobs (Gain, Volume, and Tone). This is also a very solidly constructed pedal that will hold up well to a lot of abuse. At the loudest settings there is a bit of ""hiss"", but it is easy to find where it starts and dial it back a bit.Highly Recommended!CFHEvaluation unit provided by manufacturer."
1,5,"not bla bla bla, this joyo pedals are the best, any you get. that's it! thank u joyo im your number 1 customer."
1,4,"Good:  Plenty of gain on hand.  Lots of sustain!This thing can get really loud.  It gives yourinexpensive tube amp that Marshall crunch.Built well, it's casing is made out of metal, not plastic.Inexpensive but performs and sounds just as well asboutique boxes costing 3 times as much.  If you're lookingfor your first cheap distortion pedal, forget the Boss DS-1 andget this one!  Well worth the money.Bad:  Adds a little noise & hiss specially to single coils (strats & teles).You might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise.Quieter with humbuckers but hums when I use it with my Xotic EP Booster whichI always keep on.  It doesn't happen when I boost my overdrives (OCD & Hardwire CM-2).If you move farther away from your amp, the hum disappears butyou can still hear some noise.  I guess this is typical for distortion boxes.No need to boost it though, it already has that thick & big sound to start with.It didn't come with a 9V battery as shipped, not a big deal 'cause I use a poweradapter anyway."
1,5,"I really like this one as a pre to my Fender Superchamp X2 head, especially on the distortion channel.  It really adds some nice tone and lots of overtones... the only thing to be careful of is the tone knob as that is a HUGE sweeping circuit.  I was not able to get it even close to 1/2 way without it being just ugly, but that might be preference.  Also of note is that I ran my Fender Mustang bass guitar through this (active pickups) and I loved the grit that it gave the sound.  This is a great pedal for the $$ and it feels heavy and solid like any major brand.  Very nice work Joyo, I will be buying more of your pedals for sure."
1,5,"This pedal is amazing. It is a very good sounding distortion pedal, seems to be very sturdy and the price is absolutely unbeatable. For $30 there is no reason not to try it. You won't be disappointed if you do!"
1,5,If you hate fuzzy distortion then you will love this pedal I had a boss ds 1 and metal zone mt 2 and did not like them much because they're so fizzy they are ok but this pedal sonically sounds so much better to me. it does plexi tones very well on lower gain settings and full on Marshall crunch on higher settings if that is what you're looking for then this is for you. it offers rugged construction and true bypass. the only problem I have had is that unity gain is at around 9 o clock this pedal is hot and has lots of head room props to joyo for this mi crunch box clone.
1,5,"this pedal ...i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin...wow, it cranks,..!..it really will produce marshall plexi tones....especially noticeable in the lower registers...on the E and A strings...if you want a marshall  stack sound , this is it,,,if you wanty a variety , i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions, so you can chose any amp sound you need,,,really people, for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make...and they all are super,,!"
1,5,"I've been very happy with all of my Joyo pedal's I've gotten, but I really love this one.  I use it with a crate amp with a tube pre-amp on the clean channel with my strat and it sounds great."
1,5,"A bought this pedal to see how such a cheap stomp box could get such great reviews.  Plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see.  It has tons of gain on tap, it responds well to the guitars volume knob, it creates a wall of overdriven amp tonal love.The pedal cuts through and is articulate.  It's not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock.  Think AC/DC and Van Halen to Metallica.  It's a classic rock pedal that screams!!!Buy it."
1,5,This pedal is very easy to use!  Retro sound is rich with harmonics- does have the Marshall sound- very satisfied!
1,5,"According to the ad copy, this pedal ""replicates Full-Stack Marshall crunch.""As the other reviewers will testify, it does indeed do just that.What I'm loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like.  Dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up.  Its responsive to your picking attack, its distortion is very very harmonically rich, and it does give you a Marshall type sound, good boost in the mids and bass, giving your tone the sonic density that those amps are famous for.Sad to say, it actually does the full-stack thing better than my ProCo Rat, which has for years been my favorite distortion pedal.  The Rat is fantastic and I have no plans to sell mine, don't get me wrong, but the Crunch Distortion can get the raging full-stack tones the Rat can, but has a tighter bottom end, less noise, and a more open sound than the Rat.  Individual notes ring out great on the Crunch Distortion.  Its a great pedal period.  Its a darn guitar miracle at $40.As a side point, I play lots of Ramones stuff and this pedal, more than any other, gives me that awesome Johnny Ramone tone.  I was running my gold-top with P-90's into this pedal, then into the sparkling clean '65 twin reverb setting on my Fender Mustang II (this pedal plays well with modeling amps, which is a rarity, let me tell you) and with some tweaking I was getting a FANTASTIC Ramones tone, better than I've ever got with my Rat, my Boss DS-1, DS-2, HM-2, ANYTHING else I've owned (and I've owned over 2 dozen other dirt boxes over the years).  This is the pedal that finally did it, it just nails that cranked 70's Marshall stack sound.My hat's off to Joyo.  They made a fantastic distortion, one of the very best I've ever played, and they're practically giving it away.  Buy one, you'll use it, you'll love it, you'll be happy you bought it."
1,4,i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from. there is no difference in the sound at all. this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in  a box.it does 80's hair band and 80's metal very well.if you're looking for those sounds you will not be dissapointedif you are looking for more variety of marshall sounds and the authentic &#34;plexi&#34; or &#34;brown&#34; sound get the joyo british. it nails those sounds well.
1,4,"JCM800 in a 30 dollar box? Not quite.  You can't really get there without actual tubes being distorted.To me, its good for getting that kind of over the top, wild 80s midrangey Marshall sound.  To me though, it sounds too much like a pedal, and not enough like the real deal.  To me, the Hot Plexi sounds more ""real"", closer than this.  That being said, this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi.BUT, if you turn the tone down, and scoop your amps mids significantly (I'm talking about 2 of 10 on the knob, where 0 of 10 is too much and gives you ""Kill em all"" style hollowness that isn't good), it gives a nice dark, throaty, lower-mid rich tone that would be great for metal.  Yes, you're not supposed to scoop the mids on the amp, but this pedal is nothing but mids and scooping them tames the fizzyness.  So it's like Ghostbusters ....sometimes you just gotta cross the streams, and it works to filter out some of the harshness. I'm not even talking about Vintage Metallica scooped, its just scooped enough so it doesn't sound harsh in the high end and mids and sounds more like the Black Sabbath to Scandinavian metal tone I like to dial in (basically dark and dry, has a ton of mids but doesn't sound like Boston at all).I use it with a Marshall Class Five, pedal's tone at about 3 of 10.  Amps tone controls (Marshall Class 5 through a 4x12) at Bass 3, Mids 1 or 2, treble 6, set to headphone mode for a darker tone."
1,4,"I've reviewed several Joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them...not just because of the price ($40 to $50), but also because of their (apparent) durability and tone quality that would be appreciated at any price.  But ultimately, I decided that this is somewhere between a 4* and 5* review, and I just can't give it the 5* review I've given the other Joyo products I've tried out thus far.* Extremely high output and high sustain *When I first plugged this thing in, I had it set up similar to any other distortion pedal I would try out with my Les Paul and VOX combo amp - with the dials all at 12 o'clock (50%).  Big mistake.  This pedal has an EXTREMELY high output.  Depending on the Gain setting, I was achieving output parity with the clean signal with the Volume set at around 25%.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and it's certainly better than having no headroom to set the pedal louder (a frequent criticism of the BOSS DS-1), but it's something to be aware of.Also, I read several comments here that this ""isn't a high gain distortion"".  I couldn't disagree more.  This thing has TONS of gain.  I think people are thrown off by two things: (1) The name, which pays tribute to the MI Audio Crunchbox it clones; and (2) The clarity/transparency of the tone, particularly the higher-end range, that shines through at all Gain levels.  ""Crunch"", in my mind, refers to a punchy, cleanish tone that has just a little bit of breakup in its character.  The Crunch Distortion has a tone that doesn't really breakup or get ""fizzy"" as you turn up the Gain, but that's not what ""Gain"" really is.  The Gain knob increases the saturation and sustain of the note(s), but I think people are fooled by the fact that the sound doesn't crack up.  Hit a barre chord and see how long the note holds with the gain turned up.  This actually makes the pedal very useful for lead work, also, which is one of the JF-03's strengths.* The setup is weird, but workable *Because of everything I described above, you may use some weird dial configurations to get the tone you want.  My level is usually around 25% to 40%, and is still very loud.  The ""crunchy"" classic rock tone that other reviewers talked about does exist, but only at around 5% to 15% of the gain setting.  And I had the tone knob generally working from 9 o' clock to 12 o'clock, as it got a little too bright to go any higher.  (Again, this is with Les Paul humbuckers.)  Ultimately, what I decided was that this pedal has enough bass, not too much in the midrange, and very distinct high end frequencies that come through very clearly.  If you play gigs and are having trouble cutting through the other instruments, I'd imagine this pedal would do the trick!* It's costs less than half of many of it's true ""competitors"" *While the affordability aspect is distinct from ""quality"", it cannot be ignored.  Part of my initial disappointment was based on a side-by-side comparison with my MXR '78 Custom Badass Distortion.  The latter did have a fuller sound to it, and was arguably better for rhythm work.  But that's an $80 custom shop pedal from MXR.  Try comparing this pedal to a $40 Boss DS-1 or MXR Distortion + and it blows them out of the water (in my opinion).  I'm not sure want to roll with the Crunch Distortion being the only dirt box on my board, but if you used it with a specific purpose in mind (like a lead/gain boost), you could afford this and Joyo's excellent ""Ultimate Drive"" overdrive pedal for still less than most boutique or even BOSS distortion pedals go for.UPDATE - About a week into owning this pedal, I did revise this score from a 5* to a 4* rating.  If you graded the pedal in a ""vacuum"", I could absolutely see a 5* rating for the $40 price tag.  But ultimately, there are just a few more problems and quirks about this pedal that I haven't had with other Joyo products, so the score should reflect that.  Please note also (which I didn't realize before) that the internal trim pot for ""presence"" is NOT easily accessible unless you are prepared to remove the circuit board and the three jacks that are connected to it.  A distributor confirmed for me that this is necessary if you want to make the adjustment, and I have no interest in trying to take apart fragile components for a small change that might not even do anything."
0,3,"So I agree that this pedal sounds good and the construction is very solid.However, I like to play at a substantially high volume for recording. To my surprise I hear radio noises. I tried different power supplies at different locations thru different amps and pedal boards.  Sadly the radio noise is present at high gain applications.this pedal sounds great nevertheless and worth the money. It is just you do really get what you pay for"
1,5,"so this is supposedly a fulltone ocd clone.  I can not comment on this as I have never owned or played one.  What I can say with over 30 years playing experience is that this is a great pedal especially when you take into account the unbelievably low price.I own this pedal, the vintage overdrive and crunch distortion. See my other reviews on these pedals. basically the vintage overdrive is a tube screamer. the crunch is a fairly high gain distortion pedal and this pedal is inbetween.It is built solidly and looks roadworthy.  It has reasonably decent components and it sounds great.  Is it of the same caliber as a $150 boutique pedal - no but it is pretty darn good esp for the asking price.  I WOULD HAVE NO ISSUE GIGGING WITH THIS UNIT.  The distortion is warm with the tone at 12 with plenty of tonal variation available and plenty of distortion variance available.  Lots of sounds in this unit.  And very very quiet.  Nice thickness to the sound with good bass and less ragged than the crunch distortion if that makes sense.  Much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned.  For classic rock  this is perfect.  maybe even metal but would go with the crunch distortion for thatOverall no concerns with this great product!"
1,5,"This pedal lives up to the hype. Distortion-wise, it delivers something in between a tubescreamer type OD and a full on distortion (like a Crunchbox or Rat).  I checked out several Youtube demonstrations before I took the plunge on this one.  I think the tone is actually much better in person than it appeared in the videos - more transparent and organic sounding. I have owned the Fulltone OCD in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly.  I also own a V1 Dano Cool Cat OD - which is an excellent OCD-ish pedal- but this one is getting more action these days.  I am running this into the front of either a Palomino V32 or a Jet City 20 watt combo with the amps set up just on the verge of breakup.  The pedal also plays well with others-  I am getting nice lead tones by running a TS type of OD into the front of this one.  The JF-02 is a really nice dirtbox - and not just for the price.  The fact that you can own it for 40 clams or less makes it a no-brainer for those of you who (like myself) are addicted to dirtboxes.  I have noticed some price gouging with  a few vendors on here.  Shop around.  I knew the build quality was decent because I own the Joyo Vintage Overdrive and they are both built like bricks."
1,5,"I'm a 4 string rock bass player that has purchased a LOT of overdrive and fuzz pedals. Most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass. They typically lose the low end or otherwise suck the punch and power out of the tone, are too fizzy and clanky in the top end, don't provide enough dynamics, or don't provide enough gain variation and are really more fuzz than overdrive.This incredible inexpensive box really nails it. You get everything from barely there overdrive to serious overdrive approaching fuzz, all with a great bass tone, with lots of your original dynamics without requiring a clean blend, and a usable tone knob to tweak to your liking.The downside is you have to live with yourself knowing that Joyo blatantly copies other designers circuits. The whole wheat side of me dislikes knowing this is an OCD ripoff. The frosted side of me loves that I saved a LOT of money buying this ripoff."
0,3,"The price is great.The sound is good.The power jack, however, leaves a little to be desired.My standard Boss daisy chain power supply cable comes out of this pedal 10x easier than any other pedal.I've now secured it with tape, so it should be ok.Based on other reviews, my guess is that I just got a dud and that most of them are okay."
1,5,"The Joyo Ultimate Overdrive is simply a great pedal. Tone adjustment is precise. The bright switch is an added bonus. Having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal. Construction is first rate and there is absolutly no hum, hiss, loss of signal, nor any excessive coloring of your signal. In short you get 100% drive that has a very broad range to work from. Through a tube amp it just extends the sound to levels that were not possible using the amp's gain alone. Impressive! I can clearly see why so many have stated that this pedal is so good. It just is. I'm not one to argue over perfection, and neither should anyone else that plays guitar and cares about their tone and gear. This one is a winner, hands down!And I'm not a new player either, been at it for nearly 5 decades now. I know tone, and have had great, and not so great gear. This one is a keeper! It handles everything from easy overdrive to nearly all out metal (not a metal pedal though) but it gets that drive from those huge amps of the 70's right on the money. Versatile. Smooth. Easy to dial in. What's not to like here? Forget your ""boutique"" pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal."
1,5,"This is supposed to be an Fulltone OCD clone, but to me, it sounds a bit better than the OCD, and worse.Has more low end and a smoother mid that the OCD. Thought isnt nearly as dymanic as the OCD, that may not be a good thing though, depending on your taste.If I turn the gain up past 9 o'clock, the pedal sounds more like a fuzz than an overdrive, and kills the dynamics.Thats a good thing and bad, as I like a fuzz tone, but thats not what I bought the pedal for.Overall I can live with it, its well built, sounds good and the price is unbeatable."
1,4,"I needed a phaser, and saw that the Joyo Vintage Phaser was rated well, and super cheap, so I bought it.  I was EXTREMELY impressed with it, and did some further research into their pedals.  This was one of their top-rated pedals, so I figured I'd give it a go.  I have to say that I am fairy impressed!  I get a wide range of tones coming out of this little box - anything from a light fuzz to a vintage-style high gain.  You won't get a modern metal crunch from it, so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.  If you want a nice distortion to replicate stuff from the 70's and 80's, then this is a great bet.  This pedal is currently plugged in, and I suspect that I'll keep it as part of my rig (unless I happen to get rich and find a nicer, boutique pedal, or get around to modding my other pedals.)As a reference:  I own several Boss distortion/over drive pedals (Japanese DS-1, SD-1, OD-3 and MT-2.)  I The Joyo JF-02 and OD-3 are the two drive pedals that I have hooked up, since they are by far the best sounding and most versatile drive pedals that I currently own.A side-note for the tone-freaks:  The peddle does seem to be a bit muddy.  It's great for jamming out power chords, but not so articulate when you're arpeggiating chords. (Still noticeable when you back off the gain on the pedal but crank the volume on the amp.)"
1,5,"I really liked this one.  I bought the Crunch Distortion at the same time and these are complimentary to each other as well as nice standalone.  I very much like how Joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just cannot afford to spend thousands on these overpriced ""boutique"" pedals.  I will continue to buy these products from Joyo until I find something wrong with them and at present I have nothing to bitch about at all here.  Sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound.  As an example, this is the JF-02 and JF-03 on guitar and the JF-03 on the bass as well running through the clean channel of a Line 6 Spider:[...]Buy this/these pedals and all things from Joyo, they are worth every penny."
1,4,this is a great pedal I would suggest it to anyone looking to get a pedal that would do overdrive and distortion it is a little more on the gain side and has a fizzy characteristic not to fuzzy however imo. Its fairly responsive too and the eq is opposite of say a tube screamers pronounced mids so rather flat eq. Plenty of volume and is a clone of the fulltone OCD if you want overdrive that doesn't sound like a tube screamer than this is for you. And botique quality at paupers price.true bypass so no tone loss props to joyo. P.s. crunch distortion is also an awesome pedal by joyo which does plexi tones well and is very crunchy.
1,5,No way this thing cost lest than $40.  I needed a small pedal board and didnt want to put a lot of money into pedals so I gave the Joyo pedals a try and I am pleasently surprised.  This compares very closely to my high end OD pedals I own...in a metal case???? BONUS.  I'm super happy with my Joyo pedals.
1,5,"This is a pretty hot pedal! Honestly, I have compared this against a Suhr Riot Distortion and an MXR Classic Distortion and quality wise, it is REALLY, REALLY hard to not hear the difference in terms of quality, tone, distortion / overdrive. Great price and well made. Joyo...nice job here!"
1,4,"I did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good. It does. You have to try it to believe it. I don't like the demonic face on the front though, so I knocked off a star. Otherwise it would be an easy 5 stars."
1,5,"I have heard good things regarding this pedal so I was always interested, but never pulled the trigger on purchasing it. When a buddy of mine who happens to be a professional musician began talking about it, I said I think I'd better check this out.IM GLAD I DID!boys and girls time to break open the walletsgreat tone and drive within this little boxyou'll be adding it to the board just like I did"
1,5,"Thick, harmonically rich, articulate overdrive.  Amazing sustain, booming bass, even mids, chrystal highs.The pedal responds well to the guitar's volume and easily replaces my holy fire, custom badass od, and every other OD I have.How this pedal is so cheap is beyond me.  Just buy it."
1,5,"JF-02:OMFG! No need to get all OCD about emptying your Full wallet to get the Tone needed! I tried this on Strats, an LP, & a Harrington, through my slightly modded VC5212(Webber speakers)tube amp; clean channel. No hum, noisiness,,built solid. The English instructions aren't really useful as the pedal itself is self-explanatory.I'm possibly half deaf but have been doing this for 20+ years. I'll be experimenting with a tube pre and running through a solid state to see what happens. There are many factors that make tone and this is only a small part of it. Your attitude and hands create the sound in the end. A pedal does not make you play better, practice does. If you are familiar with the OCD or can get one and a/b side by side it, you'll be amazed. Cool looking pedal box to boot."
1,5,"Like many others wanted the brand name pedal, drooled over it for years, just can't pull the trigger on a $130 pedal. Bought this instead and it plain rocks. I put my pedals through three tests, 1) playing alone, 2) Playing at rehearsal, and 3) gigs. This thing stands up nicely on all three. Using it with Am Sp Tele, Hiway 1 Strat, Squier 51, Epi LP Spec w/p/90 and Fender BJ, Peavey Classic 30/50. Sounds amazing in any combo. Using it as my gain along with the Joyo Vintage OD, for lead boosts. Killer set up."
1,5,"Just for the thickness of the sound this little jewel makes, it was worth giving this box a try. As someone else previously mentioned, set in a tube breakup setting , this device still is a little fuzzy. The tone, none the less, is very usable and sounds great. I'm a  happy customer and am sure most anyone else will be as well. Thanks for reading this."
0,1,50+ years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless
1,5,"I've had this for nearly a year and I have no complaints. Works perfectly. Sounds awesome. Lots of gain, tons more than my Boss SD-1 w/the Monte Allums SD808 mod.  If lost or stolen, I'd buy another. Highly recommended."
1,5,"Let's get a few things straight from the start - I love effects pedals.  I love the idea of a handcrafted boutique pedal (and have owned a few), and I'll also play the mass-produced BOSS and Ibanez stuff.  And if you put foreign/no-name brand in front of me, but the pedal is made well and sounds GOOD, I'll play that too.  All you need to know is that this pedal is well-constructed and sounds darn good for 40 dollars.Joyo is a Chinese company that essentially has makes their own form factor (a heavy-duty metal box with an MXR-like button switcher), and then clones/mimics/copies circuitry of popular boutique pedals that cost anywhere from $100 to $250.  And they've figured out how to ship them to the U.S. and sell them for $40 to $60 each.  I've recently discovered these pedals, and if money/pedalboard space were no issue, there's probably 8 to 12 of them I'd like to own.The ""star"" of the Joyo lineup, however, is arguably the JF-02 Ultimate Drive.  This pedal got some notoriety a few years back when an American company bought them in bulk, repainted them, and tried to sell them for almost $200.  The fact that they thought they could get that much for it tells you something about the quality.The pedal this is supposedly clone off of is the Fulltone OCD Overdrive, a boutique pedal that came out several years ago, and usually sells from around $150.  I own that pedal, and I've done a side by side comparison on my pedal board.  And while tone is EXTREMELY subjective, I'm not sure that I wouldn't go with the Joyo Ultimate Drive in a blind test.  While the 3-knob, Lo/Hi switch are clearly inspired by the Fulltone OCD, the pedals actually sound quite different.  With the exact same settings, the Fulltone will actually sound much brighter.  That's really saying something because the Fulltone is known as having a very well-rounded tone with a defined base.  Well, the Ultimate Drive offers even more bass and mids, yet the Tone knob can brighten it up quite a bit without losing that bottom end.It's actually extremely versatile.  I'm not sure that it would do low-gain ""crunch"" sounds very well, but if that's what you want, consider the Joyo Vintage Overdrive, the Joyo Crunch Distortion, or a Tubescreamer.  Right now, I have three pedals that are fairly similar and offer a great ""overdriven Marshall"" tone: The Fulltone, the Ultimate Drive, and the Marshall GV-2 Guv'nor.  While they are all great pedals, the Joyo really hits the sweet spot on my Vox Combo amp (using a Gibson Les Paul).As for soloing/lead play, I'm noticing all types of pick attack/harmonic response with the Joyo that I don't get with other stompboxes.  It really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel.  If you point all the knobs at 12 o' clock, some people may think it is muddy, but that Tone knob really does change the character quite a bit.  Sorry for the long rant, but I want people to know that just because you can't afford $150+ on a single pedal doesn't mean you can't enjoy a great overdrive stomp box.  Check the JF-02 out - it just might be your ""gateway drug"" to other Joyo pedals!"
1,5,"Until today.  I do not own the Fulltone pedal that this product was designed to replicate, but you can search YouTube and see several comparisons and there is no audible difference.  Aside from that, this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit.  It's not a ""metal"" type distortion, but it nicely covers everything else.  I play an Ibanez Artcore through a Vox AC15 in a Christian band and set with just a small amount of drive, at about the 9:00 position, this pedal does not add color to your signal and the sound of your amp shines through nicely.  That's the whole point - the reason we choose a certain amp is because we like the way it sounds, so when we push it with an overdrive pedal we don't want it to change the sound of the amp, we simply want to kick it in the rump a little.  Or a lot.  And the Ultimate Drive does it nicely.  The drive could best be described as somewhat gritty and smooth at the same time, like sand in a smoothie.  Driven hard it gives plenty of nice harmonic overtones.  But I think it sounds best with just a small amount of kick, right into a tube amp.  I'm not exactly bringing home tons of money, so it's nice to see that there are pedals designed to give great tone to even tightwads like myself.  The only thing that I could consider to be a downside is the stupid graphic of Satan, Darth Maul, Gene Simmons, or whatever that thing is that's painted on the metal case.  Other than that, if you're in the market for a ""boutique-style"" overdrive at about 1/3 the cost, you've found it. ONE FINAL NOTE: One unexpected benefit of this pedal is that the overdrive does wonders with a single-coil strat.  Really.  It gives it a nice fat crunch while somehow retaining the strat tone.  I can't think of any other pedals I've owned that could do this.  SECOND FINAL NOTE:  I'm almost embarrassed to admit this, but I also played it through a cheap solid state Fender Frontman 25R and it sounded great even through that piece of rubbish.  As a Christian musician, I can say that this may not exactly qualify as a miracle, but it's pretty close."
1,5,"Put this through an AC30C2 and prepare to be amazed. Never owned an OCD but I don't need to. My neighbors I'm sure are not pleased. Many have decribed this pedal and there is nothing else like it at this price point! It's your guitar on steriods. Crisp deplication of it with bass, treble and a little hair on it. That's at the 25% gain setting. Flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls. From nasty blues to Steppenwolf you will have it covered."
1,5,"people say its an ocd clone.  it sounds very similar.  i think it might be slightly rawer around the edges, but its a very subtle thing.  all in all, i'm happy with it.  knobs are very responsive and it offers a wide range of tones.  good pedal to add."
1,5,"I can't compare it (as others have done) with the OCD, but it simply gives me an overdrive that I love. I have several other OD pedals: Tube Screamer, LovePedal Kalamazoo and even a cheap Danelectro DS-1. The JF-02 is truly my favorite right now. I've been using it with a Strat and a Les Paul clone into either a Fender Vibro or a small Bugera V5. It serves up great tones into either one."
1,4,"You really have to play around with all the knobs to find the perfect tone, I was able to sort of dial in a nice Marshall '80s alt-rock sound, but when you're not playing it can have a noisy wind-like feedback coming from your amp; but it can vary from amp to amp. You can fiddle with the Voice and Drive knobs to clear it up, but that usually results in a drop in your overdrive or distorted sound. But to be perfectly honest, it's pretty impressive the sound you get out of this for less than $40."
1,4,"This thing sounds amazing- except for one small problem: At higher gain settings it hisses like a mother. I'm not talking about extreme settings, just gain and &#34;character&#34; (thats what Tech 21calls it- forgot what Joyo calls it) at 3 o'clock. It has a beautiful WARM singing lead tone-better than any pedal that I have owned ( and that's probably 20-30 distortion/overdrive pedals) If only it didn't hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal. If you have a Rocktron Hush or other noise gate pedal, it is worth considering. The Joyo is an EXACT clone of the Tech 21British pedal, which costs $189 (?). I don't know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not."
0,2,"I bought this with the idea I was getting a pedal that would give me usable Marshall amp sounds. After trying for a couple of hours, I find that it won't do that. I guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasn't meant to be used with this pedal. The guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control, he was spot on about that (very annoying effect). Nothing but praise goes to the supplier ( KDM Distributors) . They did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country. But the pedal itself, not for me."
1,5,This pedal solved my problem with my amp. After 13 years of messing about with my Mesa Boogie  realizing the the California sound is not what I truly like and kicked myself in the ass for not buy a Marshall or VOX this pedal  has given me the ability to make my amp sound like a Marshall or VOX.  One can say all kinds of things about quality but for $31.00 it made me even more versatile. It needs to be in front of a tube amp...
1,5,"This one is easy - buy it! I've owned many effects over 32yrs playing . . . some ok, some didn't last 48 hours, others never parted with - this one fits in that category. Gives excellent range of Marshall emulated sounds"
1,5,"been playing over 50 yearsowned it all 3 or 4 times :)pedals out the wazoothis is the cats meow if you want a marshall in a boxset your amp up cleanspend 5 minutes finding the sweet spotplay till your fingers hurt.....i own the tech 21 britishdid a side by sidecan hear NO differencei dialed in the early VH brown sound in minutesand thats where i left itcleans up with the vol knobresponds well to pick attackdo not hesitate, this pedal is a winner"
1,5,"I revised a previous 4-star review after playing with the Joyo British some more and especially after using it for direct line-in recording.  I now rate it at 5 stars.The phrase ""Marshall in a box"" gets thrown around a lot, but usually the people using it have a particular Marshall amp in mind.  For example, the Wampler Plexi-Drive sounds like an older Plexi, while a MI Audio Crunch Box will do that 80's JCM compressed high gain tone.  On the recommendations of several people, I picked up the Joyo British Sound hoping it could clone the full spectrum of those different amps.Does the British Sound succeed at that goal?  Yes and no.  On certain settings, the British Sound does offer a convincing, tube-like sound reminiscent of a Marshall cabinet.  You can clean it up quite a bit, and it works very well as a ""foundation"" pedal, placed last in your effects chain to give the amp Marshall ""character"", but boosted by other overdrive and distortion pedals.(Note: The pedal is actually its own preamp, so the recommended use of it is to plug it directly into the power amp section of a combo amp, or into a PA system or mixer directly.  You can use it in  the effects chain into another preamp, but that will diminish its effectiveness)But despite those good traits, there's just a few things ""off"" about it.  First, it seems to add quite a bit more noise (""hiss"") than some of the other Joyo Sound pedals.  Or perhaps it's just more noticeable due to the fact that this is supposed to be a ""Marshall"", so i turned it up.  Second, as several other reviewers noted, the Voice control seems exactly backwards of what it should be - turning clockwise makes it sound thinner.  On the other three Joyo Sound pedals, the opposite is true.  Functionally, this really should mean nothing, but it does make it a bit more confusing to dial in.If you read the manual for the Tech21 British (upon which this pedal is supposedly cloned), they claim that 9:00 on the Voice/Character knob would be JTM/Bluesbreaker territory, 12:00 would be Plexi, and anything above that gives you the ""presence boost of a 70's Metalface"".  I haven't tried all those amps, but perhaps it's meant to brighten up as you turn it up, and that's just a design choice.I think it's possible to get the ""Marshall"" tone you want out of this thing, but you have to work the EQ knobs with each adjustment of the Voice knob.  At this price, hard to complain too much."
1,4,"For a cheap pedal I gave this a try.  Very versitle.  Can get many different types of sounds and drive from it.  The knobs are a little tight, but that just makes feel tough I guess.  I like much more than the Joyo fuzz.  THis can give some cleans and drive to distortion.  You really need to work with it a bit with your amp and find that sweet spot.Certainly not the best overdrive, distortion, or effects pedal I have used.  But for the budget I do receomend it.  It is cheap and very has a good range of tone options.  I ran it into a Fender Camp 600 and they seemed to get along well.Hope this helps."
1,5,"Well built.Not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out.Has a good selection tones and voicing knobs really does a lot to effect sound.Simple to use. Great variety of uses for it. I like the layout of controls as well.Only bad point for me is the location of the adapter input it's on the right side,I'd prefer it to be on the top end like my other pedals. Other then that nothing I'd change. Loyal Joyo pedal user. They've got a great product for the price point."
1,5,"JF-15:again, OMFG! The MK type sounds take awhile to get, so tweak & consider your amp settings, guitar type, etc). The other pedals like it in the series I'm intrigued by, but I can get any sound I want so far with my stuff. I tried both the Joyo JF-02 Ultimate Drive OCD clone pedals individually on Strats, an LP, & a Harrington, through my slightly modded VC5212(Webber speakers)tube amp; clean channel. As with any pedal, it won't make you a better player. Only practicing, gear research & use, and your hands' touch/grip(whatever you kids call it these days)will have the final say of what comes out of the amp. I intentionally got the JF-02 after reading positive reviews all over the net. The JF-15 was a curiosity purchase. I was able to dial in sounds of Anthrax, Stryper, stratty Buddy Guy blues(remember he uses a metal finger tip clip at times-works with Pickboy metal picks), the 'dad friendly' radio rock sounds of Nickelback, Daughtry; Foo Fighters....to get your Marshall sounds takes a bit of work, but I use their Blues Breaker II reissue, Reflector and sometimes the crushing JackHammer(a BBII with more options and gain). I also use a digitech valve Hardwire for vintage 70's rock or switched to 'saturation' and mid scooped for the Pantera sounds. So, in closing, this pedal can do a lot to change the character of your amp to a Boogieish sound if you know what you're doing for the sound your leaning to."
1,5,"I was very anxious to get this pedal in the mail and try it out so that I could write a review of my own.  The reviews on all Joyo products are extremely polarizing.  Some people love them and think they're every bit as good as boutique pedals costing three times as much, while other people (including a significant portion of the hardcore techie community) despise the whole concept and wish they didn't exist.  Having tried out this specific product - the Joyo JF-15 California - I can tell you that I'm extremely impressed for only having spent $40 to $50.First, a word about Joyo.  Joyo is a Chinese company, which for a lot of people loyal to American products, starts them off on the wrong foot.  Further adding to the controversy is the fact that many Joyo pedals appear to have virtually copied the circuitry of well-known Western boutique pedals, such as the Fulltone OCD (""Joyo Ultimate Drive""), Ibanez Tubescreamer (""Joyo Vintage Overdrive""), and MI Audio Crunchbox (""Joyo Crunch Distortion"").  If you find that disturbing or appalling, I won't try to change your mind, but consider the following:  Joyo has found a way to manufacture surprisingly faithful ""clones"" of these very successful pedals at a price that even entry-level casual players can afford.  Larger companies, such as BOSS, DigiTech, and Ibanez, openly copy ideas, clone sounds, or borrow inspiration from other successful pedals.  Finally, if you want to pay more the boutique pedal, nobody is stopping you from doing that.  There are certainly areas where Joyo cuts costs by using cheaper materials, and the Joyo is absolutely not a one-for-one clone.  My personal opinion is that if Joyo has found a way to take the concepts of these pedals and make them cheaper...power to them.  But again, reasonable minds can differ.  My primary concern is: ""How does the pedal SOUND?""The answer to that question is ""surprisingly good""!  The specific pedal ""cloned"" by the Joyo California (from what I'm told) is the Tech 21 NYC ""Character"" series, which was a pedal series (apparently now discontinued) that modeled popular amps, such as Marshall, Fender, VOX, and Mesa Boogie.  Like the Tech 21 pedal, there are 6 on-board knobs, including one called ""Voice"", which essentially a transparency control - the more you turn it up, the less is sounds like your original amp, and the more it sounds like a Mesa Boogie.  There is also a 3-band EQ (Low, Mid, High), which seems to do a pretty good job crafting your tone.  Finally, there are Level and Gain knobs that work as if they were the corresponding knobs on your amp.  Fortunately, I find with the level gain at 12 'o clock, the volume is basically on par with your original signal.Trying to describe the tone in writing is difficult, and is obviously going to vary a great deal depending on your guitar, amp, and other cables and effects.  I run a Gibson Les Paul through a small VOX Valvetronix combo, and the resulting tone was good.  Most importantly, it sounded very different than the normal tones I would get through that amp.  Admittedly, I do not have much experience with using an actual Mesa Boogie amplifier, but I think people get a little too wrapped up in making that direct comparison anyway.  Obviously, if want the true sound of a Mesa Boogie half stack, you're going to have to go buy the real equipment.  But the tone that I found with this pedal was very full-bodied, yet still retaining clarity on the high strings.  The ""Drive"" knob works better at the lower and mid-level gains - it is capable of higher gains, though I did find the pedal to become somewhat noisy with the Drive knob past 3 'o clock.There are two ways to think of this pedal.  First, you could use it as an ""always on"" amp modeler if you really like the tone it produces.  In that case, you could turn the ""Voice"" up and keep the ""Drive"" low, while adding other distortion pedals effects to that base sound.  Second, you could think of it strictly as a ""distortion/overdrive"" pedal, and turn it on only for parts of songs where you want that effect.  However, one very nice (and very ""amp-like"") feature of the overdriven tone provided by this pedal is that the tone cleans up very nicely when you turn the volume down on your guitar.On a final note, the build quality on the Joyo California ""out of the box"" looks to be fantastic.  The switch is a ""click"" metal button similar to those used on MXR pedals.  There is a back cover for a 9V battery, or there is a well-placed DC 9V adapter jack, which works with standard 9V adapters such as BOSS and OneSpot.  Sorry for the length of the review, but I wanted to provide some good information based on my experiences, since I struggled to find honest reviews while I was doing research.  I can't promise everyone will like it, but considering the poor quality of the $40 pedals I used to buy from DOD, Danelectro, and Ibanez SoundTank growing up, it's pretty hard to regret giving the Joyo California a serious look at that same price.  Enjoy!"
1,5,this is a pretty versitile pedal and an asset to my board... constructed of metal and button and control knobs seem sturdy enough.. i like it with the power supply/no batteries to fuss with ... nice sound
1,5,"Wow, I am very surprised by this pedal. I got it with the intention of going aft that chimey AC30 tone, which it does a decent job at. I didn't realize everything else this pedal can do. You can get a very heavily distorted full on rock crunch out of it no problem. Metal, no problem, crystal clear and punchy, no problem, super crispy tele twang, no problem.I tried it on bass and was REALLY impressed. It is eerily similar in function to my SANSAMP VT BASS pedal and gets a lovely SVT type sound quite easily with loads of bottom end. I even threw it in my bass effects chain to use as an added OD/Crunch in front of both my head/cab as well as VT BASS and PARA DRIVER. Works like a charm.Turn the VOICE control to go from smooth and thumpy to gritty and crunchy, while adding a bit of mid range response.I only wish this had a balanced XLR out in addition to the normal 1/4&#34; out. Phantom Power would be nice then also.I would easily use this in a live setting running straight to the board, though a speaker sim afterwards would really top it off nicely and help to smooth out frequency spike here and there.  I have been thinking of trying the Joyo DI wit speaker simulation for this purpose, but I just haven't gotten around to buying it yet.In my opinion you should at least check this thing out, I mean its $40"
1,5,
1,5,"this pedal is terrific.,,,it is not a pedal to make you sound like an AC-30..the name is somewhat misleading...although you can certainly eq your sound in  that direction....the real treat is the huge variety of boost, tone and gain you can dial in,.,,its mindbending....the gain is superb....not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer..,this pedal is an audio swiss army knife..."
1,5,"I love the sound of this pedal.  It's as versatile as can be.  If you want to sound like 5 Dimebag Darrels, then don't buy this pedal.  If you want a nice drive that is responsive, this is for you.  I employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortions/overdrives.  I have noticed the on off light is intermittent, but the pedal still effects the signal either way.  For a pedal that I have stomped on so many times, I'm not even the least bit concerned.  For an inexpensive unit, this thing rules."
1,5,"I bought this pedal to use in a min rig as an experiment and I love it.  I use the pedal as a preamp going into a PA or poweramp.  The pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind.  I use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite.  It is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar.  I have a VFE Alpha Dog and an MXR Custom Badass OD before the pedal. After the pedal I use an MXR phase and Flanger, VFE Blueprint Delay and then a Byang Triverb.  When all is said and done my tone is phenomenal and no one can tell when I am not going through a more traditional amp rig.  Buy the pedal, it's great!"
1,5,WOW is all i can really say. It made a good solid state amp (80's Yamaha usa-made combo) sound great and full of nice warm tones. I'm using it into the power amp section via effects loop (bypassing the yamaha preamp) and I couldn't be more happy with the results. This ranks right up there as the best money I ever spent on equipment. A definite upgrade.
1,5,"This jewel does give a Vox AC tone (depending how its used). For direct recording it does. If used with an amp, maybe. But however you use it, it is sweet."
1,5,"I'm going this stompbox as I always do, based on the quality of the pedal and what it does - not necessarily whether than tone is ""useful"" for my particular setup.  Viewed in that objective light, the Joyo JF-13 AC Tone is an excellent pedal for $40 to $45.There are two ways to think of the JF-13 and the other ""Tech 21 clones"" in this line (California, American, British Sound, etc.).  The first is the obvious one, which is to use it as a stomp box at the end of you signal chain.  This box basically takes your guitar input and any other effects you add and then tries to ""clone"" a VOX AC30 amplifier into the speaker.  How effectively it does this really depends on your settings and the quality of the amplifier it self.  At the end of the day, if your amplifier (particularly the budget, solid state ones) has certain limitations that you don't like (too bright, not loud enough, too muddy, breaks up too easily...), no pedal (including a $200 boutique one) is going to fully overcome those deficiencies.But the second way to think of the JF-13 is as a preamp, where the output would go directly into a recording device, PA system, computer, or tablet.  I don't have enough experience trying that (though I did a little bit with the Joyo California) to say how well that works, but I've heard great examples of it online.  Also, having the convenience of amp-like controls (with 6 knobs) is certainly very convenient if you like to play/record in that manner.As for the sound of the pedal, it's very good.  I've heard complaints about the pedal being noisy if you turn the gain all the way up, but I wouldn't let that concern you.  That's true of virtually any distortion/overdrive pedal, it can be cleaned up with a noise gate/suppressor, and I think the better use of this pedal is on the low- and mid-gain settings anyway.  The ""Drive"" knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp.  It's a very nice tone, responds well to picking, and cleans up well if you reduce guitar volume (which many pedal distortions do not do).  The ""Voice"" knob is hard to describe.  Basically, it morphs the tone into something deeper and ""punchier"" as you turn it up.  But that also changes the impact of all your other settings, including drive, EQ, and level.If I had one complaint about this pedal (even compared to the California, also a very cool pedal), I was a little surprised how much this pedal ""wants to be dirty"".  It's tough for me to envision leaving it on all the time if it overdrives so easily.  But, again, I think part of that is you're basically running through two preamps if you play it through a combo.  Check out some of the YouTube recordings as to how it sounds directly into a speaker or recorder - it could be completely different in that context.  At any rate, it's a very intriguing device at only $40, and I could see finding new uses for it in the future I haven't envisioned yet.UPDATE (April 2013): I actually sold this pedal, instantly regretted it, and then bought it back.  Now that I understand how to use it properly (by bypassing the preamp of my combo amp, through the effects loop), I am able to get some great sounding clean tones out of the pedal.  It really is an excellent value, either as a ""foundation pedal"" or as an emergency tool for musicians who might end up somewhere they need to plug directly into a PA/Speaker system.  I won't be letting the AC Tone go this time :)"
1,5,
1,5,"Let me start by saying... I used to work for Line 6, so I know modeling pedals!I have nearly every modeling pedal Line 6 makes,but I was looking to minimize the rig that I take with me to the bistro-size gigs that I play most of the time. In general, all I really want is the Vox AC30 tone and maybe a delay pedal or some other single effect. I use a very small ZT Lunchbox amp for this sort of thing and it's solid state, so you basically get a nice loud straight ahead tone, which is nice, but makes our cover tunes a little less 'authentic' sounding. I heard some sound samples online comparing this pedal to the Tech21 Liverpool pedal and to my ear...there wasn't a $150 difference. Very convincing and just $40! I pair this up with a Line 6 M9 and I can get most any tone I need for Beatles, Tom Petty and all of the 60's 70's tones I need. Love this pedal!"
1,4,"You won't get AC tone from this because your tone is subjective because you are running through another amp head.  but if you are a tone hound and bored with same sound of same amp, this is an excellent product lifting the voice of your Amp.  Sorta like buying a Wah, flanger or other product, this essentially will provide another venue to push out tone.  Problem is is that you won't replicate a Vox sound found on a classic rock album, because what you are producing is a unique sound.  I have yet to try this through a loop."
1,5,"I bought this to tune my 12-string without using the end jack. The headstock is angled back the adjustments that this screen makes have made it easier to see and it is sensitive enough &#8220;feel&#8221; the tone of each string with only minor plucking.  I use it on Chromatic but it includes: Bass, Uke and Guitar too."
1,4,"Easy to use works as advertised, use it for my various stringed instruments. For the price I am very pleased."
1,5,I received the Fender Clipon Chrome Tuner in a very short time.  I know it will live up to the Finder name.  Very easy to use.
1,4,Easy to use and the clip is sturdy. A bit slow compared to the Snarks I own but I like it.
1,5,"For a Fender licensed product, the build seems a bit on the cheap side, the plastic is kinda dollar store quality, but this tuner tunes very well, comparable to more expensive Korgs or Snarks. The screen is bright, and while it does not change color, the dial is easy to read. Buy a couple and leave one in your guitar case and another one in your car, so you can always tune up for those unexpected performances."
1,5,"I bought two of these. Small but well lighted screen. Very quick reaction to string. I liked it from the very first tuning. It is quicker and more responsive than other tuners I have that cost twice the price. It is small and doesn't look like a huge lump on the headstock.  Operates with one 3V 2032 Battery, included. I plan on buying a few more for other guitar cases and as gifts for my musician friends around birthdays and X-mas."
1,5,"5 stars because it works as its described, and has a nice display. I like this better than my old Snark. It's got a better build quality than the Snark for sure."
1,5,"super tight, and very accurate... i'm not a fenfer fan but I really love this tuner... I recommend this one to anyone..."
1,5,"I have owned two Snark headstock tuners (the blue ones). They are great products but I find one thing about them absolutely infuriating: the design of the ""ball joint"" that connects the tuner to the clip. Both of my Snarks have broken off at this joint. I am a home player - I do not put the tuners under any type of stress.This Fender tuner is a great alternative. The way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a Snark. However, as others have mentioned, this Fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a Snark. So, for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented. However, for the home player, this tuner will work just fine.The tuner itself is much smaller than I thought it would be. It is smaller than a Snark (but not by much). The clip works well with a PRS headstock, which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a Strat style headstock.The only real negative I see is to change the battery (and to put the first battery in) requires the use of a very, very small phillips head screwdriver. I build computers so I had one handy, but I would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand."
0,3,"I liked this tuner, the look, the size, the ease of use, the quality performance, until it died. I think what happened is I just left it on too long. My problem was that in order to turn the power off you have to hold the power button rather than simply pressing and releasing it. Since it died that first time, it doesn't seem to perform the same. I also haven't really paid much attention to it since it died because I sent another similar tuner in for replacement, and I got an acoustic guitar that has an on-board tuner and a tuner pedal for electric guitar.I wouldn't recommend against this product. Just remember to hold the power button to turn it off."
1,5,"I have tried some others and was not to happy since they really did not tune the strings correctly (the sound was off slightly). This seems to be good for a &#34;quick tune&#34;, but like the pelal with cord plug in better. The pedal types are much bigger and you will have to carry more stuff out when going to a gig. This does work in a pinch without a lot of bigger equipment."
1,4,"This is my first electric tuner.  As a percussionist-turned-bass-player, I goofed off, stick twirled and snored through countless hours of tuning in band class over the years. Not surprisingly, I kind of laughed at my own peril when it came time to tune my new instrument.  I grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed.  It does the trick.  It's small, accurate enough to get by with general practice (I can correct minor tuning issues by ear).  However, now that I have been using it for a few months, I have noticed that it does not give a very stable reading of pitch.  For example, if I go through and tune all the strings it will read a hair high/low on the next pass, and yet again on a third pass... If you need something &#34;no-fuss&#34; and accurate the first time around to the spot, you might want to invest in something a little more robust.  But, for standard/practice tuning, this is a fine accessory"
1,5,Good tuners. Can tune several different instruments. Just be careful you have it set to the right instrument when you are tuning or you will go through a lot of strings. I have several of these. They are a great size and can be left on your instrument if you desire. Personally I prefer the Snark tuner but these are a fairly close second.
1,4,"For a cheap tuner, this one is pretty good - it's about as accurate as the Snark, and not as delicate (the ball joint on the Snark makes it prone to breakage if you're not careful packing it in a case or gigbag).The display is large and bright.  I wouldn't use it to intonate an instrument, but for quick knockaround tuning, it's fine."
1,5,"I have been using an app on my cell phone until I purchased this from Amazon.  This thing is awesome. It's so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it.  Oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound.  It does get a little sensitive when tuning, in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark.  But the more I use it, the better feel I get for it.  If you don't have one, get one."
1,5,"This little guy worked just as advertised. It's a tremendous tuner for gigging or practice when you forget your tuner or dont' feel like bringing it. It won't work the best for getting intonation right, but it hits regular tuning perfectly. Super easy to use and a must-have for anybody who gigs out."
1,5,"There are some more compact units out there (like planet waves), and the intellitouch PT10 is a little clearer to read, but this baby is great for the price. I leave it on my Strat while I play as it can be easily turned on/off as needed and stays relatively hidden behind the head stock. The back lighting is clear enough and the tuner is as accurate as my foot switch tuner. Overall, great deal for the price."
1,5,this is the most ergonomic tuner there is it functions well it is sturdy and it fits in ur pocket! count on fender to give u a good product!
1,5,"I bought two for 10 bucks each. They work great on my acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to see, and it centers quickly when tuning, without drifting all over the place. The only thing I would do to improve is add an off button. There is an ON button but the tuner will stay on as long as you are plucking/strumming strings. It will turn itself off in one minute if you stop playing, but I usually start right into playing after tuning. The only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life. This is a great little tuner and I am glad I bought it."
1,5,"Purchased this tuner awhile back to be able to check my tuning periodically without having to access my in line tuner. This is a great tuner IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE USING IT FOR. With that being said, this little clip on is not intended for gig use per say. If that is what you are looking for, an inline tuner would be much more efficient and accurate. This little guy is best suited to practice (if you are like me and don't use your primary rig for at home practice and don't feel like breaking out the old pedal chain) it does the job and does it well. Now could you use it for a gig? Sure I suppose so, but bear in mind that it is not an ""in-line"" tuner therefore any excessive background noise will cause the accuracy to be a bit off. For the price it can't be beat. It swivels (although not much) but enough that you can clip it on, read the nicely lit LCD and tune up quickly. Great product that every player should keep in the case with their guitar."
1,4,I liked the features this recorder has BUT it is a chore to figure out how to use them all.It let me know that I am not a techy. For me not so easy to get beyond the basics. It does a nice clean job for the recording I have gotten done.
1,5,"I debated between picking up this and the Zoom H4N and went with the Tascam &#8211; I just couldn't justify the extra $100 or so for the Zoom.  The unit is simple to use and the built-in microphones do a great job.  I picked it up because I wanted a portable unit that would let me use 1/8 inch, 1/4 inch, and XLR microphones with my DSLR, or capture great audio on its own.  This accomplishes all of that &#8211; although I need to use an adapter for 1/8 inch mics (for the 1/4 inch ports &#8211; there is no 1/8 inch mic port, which seems an odd omission.)The unit is almost entirely plastic, which can feel a bit inexpensive &#8211; I know that one selling point of the H4N is its sturdy construction.  Still, it seems well made and I think it's a fantastic recorder for the price."
1,5,"I've only spent a few hours with it, but so far, it is fantastic. I wanted a simple grab and go recorder for songwriting sessions, jams rehearsals and gigs, but I also wanted the option of just capturing a line source (such as from the DI on my bass amp). Bingo. Toss in the Dual Mode, overdub, phantom power, ability to run off USB power, and it is a total winner in my book. When you select the recording format and encoding or resolution (WAV + bit and resolution, MP3 + bit rate, etc)- each setting indicates how much recording time you have for the inserted card. I also love that it uses full size SD cards (microSD can be used with an adapter of course)- they're much easier to label and keep track of than a bunch of pinky-nail sized micros. I'll update this review after I've had some more time with it."
1,4,"I purchased the DR-40 for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs, and it accomplishes that very well.  The battery life is great, the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it, and the build quality is pretty solid.  My only issue is the internal mics, while crystal clear in terms of quality, can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things.  In addition, they are VERY susceptible to wind, even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air.  I highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery."
0,1,"Wow, the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry, but plug in some real mics and voila- the DR-40 becomes something special.... But, I do not always want to carry around so much equpment, and was hoping for better internal mics.Honestly, my super cheap Olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing.And WHY is the line-out so darn noisy!? Must be defective. Oh well... Gonna, have to send this back."
0,3,"allotoday went to the stores to TEST out the followingtascams...dr 05,  dr 07 mk2, and dr 40  and, for myself,ended up buying nothing...their differences for YOUR  ears...are....dr 05,  this is a good quality toy...NO line in...use its own mic, you will be ok  with this, for meetings, etc.NOT really that good for  music...can be done, but NOT as good..if you use ext mic...u wont be happy either...HIGH background HISS noise  relative to all 3.dr 07etc etc...only slightly better than 05...all else same...dr 40 was MUCH quieter in noise level...be it...in mic, ext mic or LINE inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars...this can be used to ( semi ) record music too.so, testing on their own mics...that last one was far far better than the first two...for those wantingLINE in...means only that dr 40...however,my tests involved  checking  sound QUALITY  of bit more seriousLIVE recordings...took output from our  zoom r 24 recorder  and  output to the dr 40...upon comparing the resulting  CDs...a / mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd,  vs...b / recorded dr40 printed to cd...the sound was Obviously better  with  a /no need to buy  any  a/d recorder attempt at this price level ,if one is looking for semi serious  Master recorder...my budget must be tripled at least...and then to go out to test some more !no cheap way, is there....for those curious, the whole idea has come from wanting to connect  2 units of zoom r24,  NOT wanting to use computer software,  taking the 4 outputs from these two into a clean mixer or analog sum box,  and getting them downto  2 channels, and finallly to some mastering digital recorder....hoping perhaps the tascam ss r100 or r200 MIGHT do the trick,in the tests to come....many thanks, and may your camels always have two humps !k"

1,5,"I bought this recorder to capture live audience audio for a live video project.  I can say that it worked amazingly well for this and did an excellent job at recording the bands without any distortion or excessive noise.  The recorder stores two files at the same time, one being a file at your chosen sensitivity and another safety track at a lower level in case there are any clipping issues with your main recording.  This accounts for quick transients or anything that might cause the recorder to overload and ensures that you will get a good take.The microphones can be folded out to extend the stereo field or in to tighten the field.  In addition, you can use external microphones or XLR inputs for professional-level input from the soundboard.  I found that the internal microphones did a wonderful job of reproducing the audience experience and I can't say enough good things about the performance.  This is an absolutely wonderful recorder.Bottom line: Highly recommended"
1,5,"I recently purchased this recorder and have compared it to my older M-Audio Microtrak II. The Tascam is a much newer design and shows good ergonomic improvement. The internal mics are adjustable, the interface is easy to use, the battery life is long and the batteries are common AA and easy to replace on location.I've not tested the external xlr mic preamps but have recorded with the internal mics with absolutely wonder results. The internal preamp is very quiet, the mics on acoustic grand piano are very dynamic, produce excellent detail and have what appears to be a very wide neutral frequency response. The recorder produces a very wide and deep soundstage and does outclass my older recorder in every aspect. To me the price is very reasonable and the build quality is reasonable for the price. Highly recommended."
1,5,"It does a fantastic job. I've had it for almost a year now, still works as well as the first day. Perfect condition."
1,5,"I am starting out learning to play guitar. I wanted a way to record myself playing guitar onto my laptop so I could go back and listen and to also play both lead and rhythm parts and mix them together.After asking a few questions on a message board, the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 was recommended to me. It's pricier than some of the options I was considering but given the reviews I figured it was worth taking a chance.I'm glad I did. The Scarlett 2i2 is a piece of cake to set up, even for a guy like me that's pretty PC savvy but never dealt with external recording devices.I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and everything installed flawlessly. The drivers loaded without a hitch and immediately recognized the Scarlett when I plugged it in.The included Ableton Live 8 Lite software recognized the unit as well.I'm looking forward to using the Scarlett more to improve my guitar playing. So far, I'm very happy with my purchase, even if it was a little more than I initially wanted to spend."
1,4,"Purchased to provide professional level I/O for recording from mixers etc.Works very well for that purpose; also and probably especially useful as location recorder with just a laptop and condenser microphone(s). The bus powered connection is as simple as it can possibly get, and the package is about the size of a fat paperback book. Inputs provide for microphone(phantom powered or not), instrument, balanced line on TRS, and balanced line on XLR connector.Tested with bass and guitar via instrument input also sounded very good indeed, and dead silent. Output of high quality material also sounds superb ... and compares well with other very high quality gear. Everything about this unit is a cut above the units from its competitors in this (crowded) price point.Though lacking lots of the I/O and routing options you get with more expensive units, this device, unlike most other products in this price range, has a quality feel to its enclosure, jacks and controls. Drives headphones, even inefficient ones, to satisfying levels cleanly.The input controls have a helpful feature wherein if you have set things too ""hot"" the color changes briefly to red -- helpful to bring your attention to your proper metering (in SW) to adjust your levels.Re computers and drivers: almost all the tests went well. On two laptops running Windows 7, installed the latest drivers from the focusrite web site and initial tests of playback and recording went great. One of these recorded perfectly also. The other, which has a core 2 duo processor (FWIW), had issues recording properly, and no matter which of the three possible usb drivers were installed, and I tried them all, this problem remained. So, for certain windows laptops, you may want to hang onto the receipt until you verify proper operation throughout. This issue is why four starts rather than five.On a happier note this interface ""instantly worked"", with absolutely no installation, on a linux desktop running ubuntu studio 12.04 ""precise"". So for linux users this may be a very attractive option.Lastly documentation and bundled software is ""light""; this is fine if you know what you are doing but it would not hurt focusrite to provide a bit more substance in their user guide for novices connecting various types of gear - guidance re best practices etc.But this is a nit -- overall a superb value provided your computer interfaces happily."
1,4,"I'll start off by saying that I've had this interface for about 6 months now and it is still going strong. I think that anyone, especially the beginner, looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit. Not only does it provide 2 channels, but it also has monitor out and headphone out. This could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio.However, I have a few gripes with the 2i2. The headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it. This is purely the ""feel"" and does not really hinder performance. But it makes the unit feel cheap, at the controls. IMO, the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly. Moving on, while on the topic of knobs, the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators, but once again, aesthetics.Why 4 stars?The problem must of started happening today because I never noticed it before. Or it could be just that, maybe I never noticed it. Anyways, shortly after I engaged the 48v phantom power, the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing. Once again, this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away. I hope that this issue does not show up in all of the Scarlett 2i2 interfaces. I would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios. Hopefully, just my unit is defective and it isn't something that is common among the 2i2's.Another thing to note is that while Direct Monitoring is a feature on this unit, the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use. In other words, I am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record ""hotter"" and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor. Nevertheless, it is a feature that can be utilized though.So in the end, 4/5 stars! The packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic, but yet appealing, thumbs up for that. I really like the build quality of the interface and Focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit. The only issue that I would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged. Overall, great entry level interface/sound card!"
1,5,"This audio interface is fantastic. It takes a little getting used to, but after an hour you will have it mastered. The sound quality is great! The direct monitoring is a little quiet, but that is no complaint all things considered.All in all, if you need a budget system at home: get this. It is perfect for Mac or Pc."
1,5,And sounds crisp.  I had alesis io2 express which did a similar job.  But after hearing a subtle difference in a youtube video I finally broke down.  I heard more definition with the guitar.  Now that I have it I take the quality for granted.  It has higher quality and the dials feel solid.  The little limiter lamp is awesome.  I'm very happy with it even if my old alesis was doing the job.  My old Alesis had midi pass through which didn't work anyway so feature for feature this is a better pick even if it's around 40 bucks more.
1,4,I've been using Ableton for 4 years and it never crashes. I connected this interface with LIve 9 on windows 8.1 i set my default playback and recording device as &#34;Line Out Scarlett 2i2 USB &#34; and set it as my default device. It crashes every time  in Ableton but works well with listening to music either on my computer or on YouTube. Sometimes i hears pops and clicks after 5 minutes and have to reset the ASIO4ALL driver which is the same issue with my Audio Technica at2020 USB MIc.My computer is an AMD system and i have used my at2020(USB) on a Dell intel laptop but i never heard any pops and clicks even after using for hours so i am not sure whether this has to do with different hardware used in different computers or whatsoever but. i think it would be better to use this interface on and intel based system because through my experience.
1,5,"I'm using this unit to set up a Linux Digital Audio Workstation. It works out of the box with a recent ubuntu install or linux mint if you prefer. You will probably want a realtime kernel and use jackd to take full advantage of this device. Without using a jackd interface or a realtime kernel audacity records 96kHz but skips when duplexed, I mark this up to not having sophisticated controls or realtime enabled.The following settings are the best I've been able to manage in jackd2 without and xruns on a realtime kernel(using qjackctl) (I'm also no expert)Frames / Period: 128Sample Rate: 96000Periods / Buffer: 3Which gives a predicted latency of 4msWith a 10ft 1/4 inch patch cord (to run jack_iodelay) I got a consistent 8.24 ms overall latency (not bad imho).Without the realtime kernel you should expect xruns with these settings, my computer is a sandy bridge pentium 2.2ghz with 6gb ram and a ssd.We have used this with an AT2020, AT2021. SM58 microphones and the sound quality is quite high. The preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions. Simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding. I've also tried some higher gain recordings of weird ambient sounds (rain crickets) and still received very little noise from the device itself but can hear everything that happens in the house.Update:I've found the above setting in jack don't work well for processing live guitar effects in rakarrack. Here are the best setting I could come up withFrames/Period: 512Sample Rate: 48000Peiods/Buffer: 3RealtimeSoft ModeQjackctl lists the latency of 32ms but I have not tried measuring i with jack_iodelay. All the included effects of rakarrack work on my computer for these while booted in the (hard) realtime kernel"
1,5,"This little fellow is great. The proper connection from the Focusrite comes with the box. Hooks to the USB port on my MacBook Pro. Everything else plugs right in. No hassle with the right jacks and stuff. My headphone jack was a different size but I went from 1/8 to 1/4&#34; with a reducer I had on hand. I can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program. I've been recording using Garage Band. Works great. Anytime I can get a product that works as it's suppose to without a lot of hassle hooking up cables or other stuff, it's a 5 Star in my book. Oh. There are two ports for speakers on the back side I haven't used yet. Just trying to decide what speakers to purchase."
1,5,"I bought this as an interface between my mixer, instruments, and mics to my Macbook for Garageband.  You have to go in and change the input and output in OSX, but it works great!"
0,3,"I use this little guy in connection with my DAW and digital piano.  I run the piano sounds through balanced cables into the line-in ports for recording, and I also run VST intruments on my DAW that I trigger via USB MIDI from the piano and use this device for digital/audio conversion.  I listen through Sennheser HD 595 headhphones plugged in to this and I also have some studio monitors attached using balanced cables.I purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface, the Behringer UF0202.  That device worked quite well for this purpose as well but lacked two things: a volume knob, and balanced in/outs.  The volume knob thing I could work around, but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops (even with a ground lift plug), so I needed to go with balanced cables.  I'm glad I did.  The balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems.  This was a good purchase.  However, I would say to anyone who doesn't need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the Behringer.  It's a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well.  Further, it's class complaint so you don't have to use Behringer's drivers.  It's plug-and-play.I have some good things to say about the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (all about the hardware) and some bad things (all about the software).  I've tried using the driver version 2.1, which came with the disk, and the udpated 2.2, which I downloaded from Focusrite's website.To let you know what I need in an interface:1. Balanced stereo in/out2. High quality headphone amp3. Volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4. Good digital-to-analog conversion5. Low output latency (input latency not important to me)I don't use the Mic preamps, which is one of the big selling points of this device.================ The Good ====================This box is simple and well-designed.  It does what you want, has very convenient controls, and has high build quality.  I'm pleased with the digital-to-analog conversion.  It has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp.  It has switches so each input can be a line-in or microphone pre-amp.  It has a switch for zero-latency monitoring (of whatever is coming in).* The headphone amp was of particular concern for me.  I use headphones a lot and a poor headphone amp can be quite a problem.  The Behringer headphone amp was only ok.  Specifically, it has an output impedance of 50 ohms.  The rule of thumb for good headphone/amp matching is that the output impedance should be 1/8 the impedance of the headphones--my hd 595's have 50 ohms of impedance.  Breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response.  In my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass.  Most manufacturers don't list their output impedance, possibly because they are embarrassed.  Anyway, Focusrite does, which is one reason I trust them a little more.  The output impedance is less than 10 ohms--respectable but not amazing.  Still not as low as I would need in principle but I can notice an improvement in the bass response in my headphones.  There's plenty of extra voltage here too, so I could drive higher impedance cans if necessary.  Anyway, good headphone amp.  Check.* Balanced ins and outs work very well,  The ins accommodates a 1/4 TRS style in and XLR.  The light around them shows when something's actually coming in and shines red when it's in danger of clipping.  There's lots of gain available.  I have them turned all the way down almost.  The outs are TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and are located on the back.* I like the look of the box, with a red metal case, and the front and back are sturdy and attractive as well.* The USB cable is just a type B port.  This means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever.  The Behringer, for example, was hard-wired to its cable...king of annoying.* It's bus-powered.  I actually would have been fine with a wall-wart, but this is even more simple.I really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware.===================== The Bad =========================The driver for this thing is horrible under Windows XP.  I have a clean installation with nothing installed except my DAW software, acrobat reader, and this driver.  I mean, my computer is really stripped down.  Performance using the Behringer was good.  The latency (time between playing a note and hearing it out the speakers) was 8 ms using the Behringer, which isn't really perceptible.Unfortunately the focusrite driver, though it's technically ASIO apparently, doesn't have anything like an acceptable latency.  The lowest latency I could set it at and get sound out instead of crackles and pops was 23 ms.  At that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy.  It's very difficult, at least for me, to work with a large latency like that.I was ready to return this device when I decided as a last ditch effort to install ASIO4ALL.  That's sort of an ASIO driver to use if you absolutely cannot make the manufacturer's driver perform at a decent level.  I installed it and it worked.  The output latency was a tiny 4.3 ms (only .3 of which are actually output latency, so this is REALLY impressive).  I conclude that the hardware is very, very good in this machine, but the software is horrible.Unfortunately, you can't actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn't recognize the device and it never even turns on--it's not class compliant, unlike the Behringer.  So now I have two drivers for it installed, only one of which I use.The bad news is that this configuration is very buggy.  In general when I just turn the computer on and try and play my VST instrument, all I get is crackles and pops until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer.  The funny thing is that it doesn't matter where the buffer starts out, I always have to increase it before I get any good sounds out.  I can start it out with a huge buffer--lots of latency--and it will crackle until I open it and increase the buffer yet more.  I have to do this every time I turn on the computer.  Also, sometimes if I leave it on for a while and come back, it will be crackly again until I increase it yet another step. We are talking about major bugs here.I decided to try ditching ASIO4ALL and trying to make the focusrite drivers work again--maybe there was a setting I was missing.  As I was trying to set the buffer size, I heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer rebooted.  When it came back I couldn't get good sounds out, even when I turned the buffer way up.  Tried rebooting a few more times, still didn't work.  So I uninstalled and re-installed the focusrite software.  At first it didn't work.  I had to install ASIO4ALL as well, and now I can sort of get sounds out of it, half the time.I hope you are getting the idea.  These drivers are terrible.  Awful.  A monkey could have written a better driver.  I would give it 1 star if it wasn't for the fact that the device works very, very well when all the stars align and the driver recognizes the drive and allows it to play.  I guess I'm willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for nice hardware when it works.  I would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical.The good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them.  I'm hoping for that.  They have already revised the driver once, which is amazing because even the 2.2 driver is seriously an abomination, just like the 2.1.================ Closing Thoughts =======================Unfortunately, there really isn't a USB interface that has a good driver.  The Behringer driver always worked, but if you moved the interface from one USB port to the other, it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver.  However, you didn't have to use the Behringer driver and ASIO4ALL would give you 11 ms and perform without any complications.  That's about as trouble free as I've seen in this type of device.If you read about the Presonus Audiobox USB and the M-Audio Fast Track Pro (probably the two closest competitors to this focusrite), what you get is a bunch of comments just like this one...horrible, horrible drivers that never get fixed. Actually Mackie makes a competitor as well, the Onyx Blackjack--but the reviews of that show that the driver is possibly even worse than this one. Unfortunately none of the pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers, so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time.  Maybe it's better under mac.  I don't know.Interestingly, this is really the only USB 2.0 device in this range.  That's quite shocking considering how long the USB 2.0 standard has been around.  The only real implication of this is that the USB 1.1 devices like the M-Audio and Presonus can only do two channel 24/96 audio in OR out, not both at the same time.  There's not enough throughput in USB 1.1.So in light of the competition, the Focusrite looks kind of ok.  Unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers--at least in this range of device--think there's no need for good hardware and (especially) good software.  At least the hardware in this one is up to spec.  We can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future.Bottom line: this is a fantastic, 5-star device...if you can make the software work consistently.If you are on a tight budget or don't care about balanced in/out, I'd recommend you go with the Behringer UCA202 or UFO2020.  They are tons cheaper, class complaint, and have better drivers.  If you use a high impedance headphone with it, even the headphone amp is pretty good on that one.================ Update May 2012 ==============A new version of the driver, 2.3, came out since the writing of the above.  The new driver actually works.  I have stopped using ASIO4ALL and I get decent latency.  Once in a while--not too often--it will inexplicably require me to edit the settings and increase the buffer, and some percentage of the time when I do that it will reboot my computer.  If I don't change anything, most of the time, it works ok.  I would never use this in a mission-critical setting (i.e., gigging or pro work), but for my home use, it's good enough now.  If you have issues with the driver, definitely update."
1,5,"I write and record my own music.  When I upgraded to a new computer with Windows 8 it wouldn't support my M-Audio Fast Track Pro so I had to upgrade.  The Focusrite Scarlett worked right out of the box.  I replaced the stock cable with a Monster cable and my recordings sound great.  Very easy to use.  Just plug in a microphone or guitar, set your levels, and start rocking."
1,5,Small amazing good quality interface. This is not the PreSonus board but the controls are easy set up is quick and it is so portable. I especially like the dual inputs on front. Back light on knobs shows clipping on volume (green and red) and connected (green).USB powered and plug and play. My Ableton Suite detected and connected in seconds.
1,5,"For me being a solo 12 string guitar and vocal act this works just fine for me. And you get the extra plugs ins supplied by Focusrite too with this interface. I cannot say I am wild about the included software which is Ableton Live Lite 8. I really disliked the screen views of Ableton and thought they were hard to view. So I did some scouting around and talked to a few techs and they suggested Mixcraft 6. WOW! I like a mixing board that is right up in my face and no guesswork. Mixcraft 6 is so user friendly and you don't have to bring in a professor from another planet to understand it. You can be laying down and recording tracks in no time. And shouldn't recording be fun and not frustrating besides? The Focusrite Interface recognized Mixcraft 6 as if it were an old school bud and the extra plug ins. So all and all it turned out great and I am a happy camper. This in my opinion is one of the best entry level Recording Audio Interface units around. It also has phantom power for those of you who have condenser mikes requiring phantom power. Dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface. Engineered in England. And on the downside, made in China. (Isn't everything these days?)"
1,4,"I desperately needed a real audio interface, I was tired of my toy Behringer 1 i/o RCA usb thing.  After reading reviews online, this seemed like exactly what I needed.  It's small, lightweight, and fits nicely on my desk.  It's got some solid pre's, and has enough for me to work with.  I didn't need the extra i/o enough to break the bank, so 2i2 is all I wanted.  I'm really pleased with this, the quality is great and the ease of use is just as great.  It handles line and mic inputs just as well, and the general rule of thumb sticks here that ~70% (about 2-3 o'clock on these knobs) is a good base level for the pre's.  Phantom power works fine, and the direct monitoring switch is really useful.  I don't like dealing with latency in Ableton, so to be able to just monitor directly when I'm playing instead of waiting for it to go through all that processing is great.  And the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other...all in all I'd say the design of this is very user friendly.Some people reported driver issues with this, and I can't say I've really had any problems.  I'm using Windows, and I have to suggest using the ASIO drivers whenever possible.  I had some issues with iTunes where the audio would just stop and the level (in the Windows sound menu) was frozen at whatever had been playing.  All I had to do was disable and re-enable in the device, but that got kind of annoying.  I e-mailed Focusrite about it, and they were pretty prompt with getting back to me, but the problem kind of faded away so I never really figured out what that was.  I started using Fubar2000 because it supports ASIO, and I haven't had ANY issues with any program that uses an ASIO driver.  I have since started using iTunes again as well (still much easier to manage the library in there), and the problem has only manifested itself once or twice since then, so who knows."
1,4,"My only gripe is that once in a while after it's been on for a long time it seems to drop out / stop working in windows 7. I've tinkered with my usb power-save settings, etc, and it still seems to be an issue. Not that big of a deal as it doesn't do it when actively being used, but about once every other day I have to unplug the USB and reconnect it. Could be my system, could be the pre-amp, otherwise no complaints.Though be wise and download your drivers from the website, not the included software. I don't even know what is on the software but I think it's a full version behind what you'll find on the website."
0,3,"Good sound, very very low noise (except on high gain), when switching to direct monitoring the output volume cuts to half, expensiveIf you're planing to record on computer, buy a USB mixer for the same price you'll get a lot of stuff and a mixerWorks with iOS if you have an external power supply (powered hub)"
1,5,"Well built, easy setup, very quiet. Using with Procaster, worked well enough but better with addition of FEThead, high quality unit."
1,5,"I've used more than a handful of USB/Firewire interfaces over the past decade. In the past, it's always been a crapshoot, regardless of brand or reputation. Instability, incompatability, and frustration abound with audio interfaces. That being said, this has been the best interface I've ever owned.The size is fantastic, the preamps sound great, it has phantom power, it looks cool, and most importantly, it's been rock solid ever since I installed it two and a half months ago.I frequently leave my PC on 24 hours a day with this plugged in, and as of yet I haven't had a single crash, dropout, 'pop' etc. It's performed flawlessly since day one.Regarding sound quality, my recordings have never sounded better. I've used this to record electric guitar straight into the unit, acoustic guitar via condenser mics, dynamic mics, hammered dulcimer, cello, synth via direct input, and it handles it all flawlessly. I'm seriously impressed with the quality.Finally, it's small enough to take with me when I want to record at a friends house on my laptop.I've used it with Reaper, Sonar X1, Guitar Rig 5, Cubase LE, all without a hitch, on two PC's - Both Win 7 64-bit. The drivers gave me no hassle installing, and as I said above, ROCK SOLID.Your mileage may vary, as I stated earlier audio interfaces can be quite the crap shoot. Same setup, same hardware, etc, and one person can have wildly differing results. That being said, I would definitely recommend this unit, as it is my favorite of all time, and I've used everything from crappy firewire mixers to high-end MOTU interfaces.Great for the price, and if 2-in/2-out works for you, it should perform better than interfaces costing twice as much. It performs better than my old MOTU 828 mkII that I got for five hundred."
0,1,"UPDATED 3/16/2014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review.The 2i2 is a simple set-up. Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a ""low-headroom"" instrument to it, run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters. It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton, but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless. (Ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!I wasn't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR, an Ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, I screamed ""Ballsdogit!!!"", and purchased a license for Reaper. After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months, I began to realize that my monitors no longer ""lock up"", but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. Now I'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers. Garbage focusrite! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. I have yet to experience a crash, but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously, I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from David@focusrite actually saying that ""you should not use this setup to record electric guitar.."", and that if you need to record electric guitar you should ""get something with more headroom like the 2i4."" That is just unbelievable in my eyes!I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? Besides that, I'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING!!!????The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. I constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here."
1,5,"Great deal on a capo, it's about the same quality as one i would buy for 5x the amount elsewhere.  It takes a while for the shipping, but that's stated in the description.  I was pleasantly suprised.  I would recommend this capo."
1,5,I used this on my bass and I don't know what more you can say about it. It works and does at it is supposed to. I have no issues with quality or feel it's too loose.
1,5,this was a gift for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar. He has enjoy and likes using the capo.
1,5,Arrived as expected and as described. Capo is well made and is very well priced. I am very happy with the purchase.
1,4,"This one works, it can't make me play any better (wish it could) but it wont make me play any worse."
0,3,How far wrong can you go for $1.83? I can give these away to beginners that don't have a capo.If you really want a capo get a Keyser or other decent capo. They're only $20.
1,5,This item did the job it's made for. Made well and you need to make sure you open it fully prior to inserting it onto your guitar neck to keep it from snapping back on you because it's strong but it won't damage your guitar and it's effective.
1,5,"When I attached it to my guitar(s), I said, &#34;Wow, this beats it's more expensive competition! Does it hold? Yes. Does it damage your instrument? No. I'm going to get another one before they decide to raise the price!"
1,5,"Nice product, I like the great feel as the handle angle is large and makes it very easy to remove."
1,4,A very decent capo. Switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly. Great for someone who plays on alternate tunings or someone who likes shifting scales often.
1,5,"I've got several capos, from the highest end models to the cheapest, and this one is every bit as good as the expensive ones, with ease of use and solid build quality. Why spend more?? Just buy it, and stop over paying for your capos forever more!"
1,4,"nice item...works well...great price, no need to own one of the more expensive ones for the job it does. I have to type more... oops got enough typed :)"
1,5,"This appears to be a good sturdy capo with a strong spring and a rubber appearing pad on back to protect your guitar neck. It looks fine and works well on the neck to hold down the strings, just as it was designed to do. It looks and fits just as shown in the picture. I recommend it."
1,5,"Not much you can say. The headline says it all. It works well. Shipping takes time but for the price, who cares. If you need it now, go local but if you have time to wait, this is perfect. I ordered two just in case. But it is nice and does not damage the guitar finish at all."
1,4,Its not a very big capo like it looks in the picture and is sometimes hard to get on sometimes. but it does hold on to all strings so the job is done. the only problem I have with it is that I get the strings a little bent but that might just be me.
1,4,My old cable was stiff and unruly. This one is not so stiff and is very well built. Buy it.
1,5,"Is a nice cable,,god quality  as always with the Fender brand... Guys if you need a cable that are not high budget,, and a god quality this is the cable...."
1,5,"This cable arrived today and I am still in shock! It's truly amazing. The best BY FAR patch cable I have EVER used, or even seen in 25 years of guitar playin.HUGE value! Buy one now!"
1,5,"This amp cable is perfect.  It fits my need for practicing.  It's just the right length for sitting on the couch, strumming daily.  I would like this one for each amp I own so I'm not always taking it from amp to amp.  I will buy some more of these.The cable also looks nice and completes the Fender look.  I would highly recommend this and give it a no-brainer 5 star rating.  I have nothing negative to say about this."
1,5,Very durable cables ... I've used them all. Fenders aren't bad. I have used these without any problems whatsoever! See for yourself!
1,5,as expected for a beginner. I'm just learning what I want and what I need. This cable works fine for my needs right now.
1,5,"I received the Fender cable exactly as shown in the picture.It is a thick cable with the ends of the jack and start of the cable enveloped in the white plastic strain relief.It looks great, was fairly cheap, and built to last."
1,5,Fender 1A-SX2S-JTXK 10-Feet Performance Series Guitar Cable ig good Stereo cable for guitar or keybord.It's long enought. I recommend it
0,3,Even though it is Fender it was made in China I would have thought the US.  What can you say about a guitar chord?
1,5,"If you need a cord and don't want to pay a lot, this is a good one.  I was surprised howsturdy it appears. The only part that is not so good is that it is a straight connector nota right angle but it works fine."
1,4,Very nice cable but the white ends (which are nice looking) could be a little shorter.  It works awesomely and it's not a bad price for name brand cables.
1,5,"Nice looking,nice sound and quality to these cables.They are what I needed!Thank You GO-DPS for making such good quality products."
1,5,Delivers just what you want in a guitar cable and the quality is what you would expect from a Fender product.
1,5,"I'm pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years. (I haven't found a wireless unit that I feel comfortable with on stage yet) I was usually replacing the cable connected to my guitar about every three to four months until I purchased these. At first I purchased one just to check them out, but after six months. I decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these. There just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too. They last forever! Definitely worth the money!"
1,5,"Got this for my electric guitar. Does its job just fine and the white tips look quite nice, a truly great product!"
1,5,These Fender 10 foot Guitar cables are by far the best bang for your buck!Every part of these cables are quality.
1,5,"This is a Very nice cable, I like this one better than all the other ones that I Own, Its thick and the sound is great. Then one day an Amp was bumped over in such a way that the cable end was broken or sheared off, That stunk"
1,5,"Does what it's supposed to do.  Very sturdy feeling.  Pretty sure I could strangle a person with it if I had to.  I'm not a dangerous person but you know, when people request wagon-wheel......."
1,5,"I seriously never knew steel guitar picks existed i've been playing guitar for like 5 years. These picks are the BOMB!, + they don't break on you when you strum too hard/fast :D, i would rate this product 6 stars if i could i'm completely satisfied with these picks!Tip: These picks are great for HIGH ACTION/HIGH GAIN GUITAR SOLO'S."
1,5,"I play bass with these and they have a unique tone.  The scratchy surface gives it a really gritty tone for rock music.  Makes Rotosound strings really sound off.  I have not found that they are so hard on strings that the strings were out from use rather than the picks.  It does take a bit of use to get good with them, but it is worth it for when you need that really growling tone."
0,3,while the product is everything it said it would be.  I was just hoping it would be thicker as it feels so thin. it does whats is supposed to so I cant fault it in that way it. just was not what I was hoping for.
0,3,"These are a little course for what I wanted. Brass is a lot better, and the edges are too sharp for fast picking. They may be giving the strings a little premature wear, and the loss of tonality is the problem. There are better options if like me you like your picks hard and firm."
1,4,The picks are good. They are a little flimsey but are ok. The best thing about them is the look
1,5,"At first I thought the idea of using a metal pick was outrageous, but after actually trying one - I love it. It has really helped me deliever that Fatal Blow...I can honestly say, this is not for strumming or even heavy metal rhythms as you risk breaking a string and putting an eye out. Not to mention that it's hard to strum and sounds awful.What these picks are good for is leads. Rock, Metal, Shredding and even Country. The sound is short with a very high tone pitch. Switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull. One plus is, while recording I do not hear much in the way of the pick scraping when doing alternate picking (shredding) as I did with a plastic pick.I still use a plastic pick for slow leads that need that sort of sound, but love these picks when things heat up. Also, I'd like to add that even though I can play Rock You Like A Hurricane by the Scorpions - it never sounds quite right. Until Now. Using a metal pick make the lead scream and help the tone carry for a thicker sound.Also, these picks have a no-slip grip. With the Fender facing your fingers, there is a nice little indent for the thumb and with the added grooves it's very easy to grip and use. It feels funny at first, but I got use to it really quick.I can honestly say that this is one of those things you just have to try for yourself to get the full experience..."
1,5,"I was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy (or thick) guitar pick.  I saw this and had to try it.  They are very solid, don't bend, and make a particularly pleasing sound on an acoustic guitar.  Haven't tried them yet on an electric, but they should be great there, too.  You need to know that they make a metalic sound to the picking action (not a surprise!).  But the angle of attack on the strings can either increase that or lessen it somewhat.  Anyway, these are great guitar picks if you're looking for something solid and long-lasting."
1,5,I've found no issues with noise or build quality so far; the 1 foot length lets you stagger or make those connections for large pedals or one which put their input/outputs in weird places.
1,4,"I bought these because I needed just a few more inches to reach a couple boxes on my pedal board.  I have the Planet Waves patch cords called 6&#34; so I thought these would cover it being 12&#34;.  When I went to hook up, they were still too short so I immediately blamed these cords.  OOOOOPS, took out the tape measure so I could complain and found that these are indeed 12&#34;  I then measured the Planet Waves and found they were actually 10&#34;, not 6&#34;.  My bad!  These seem to be good quality and they are exactly what they say they are.  If you want to spice up your board, go for some color!"
1,5,"At this price, these cables are a bargain.  The jury is still out on how durable they are, but they all arrived in working order and have held up well despite several months of plugging and unplugging.  The length is great for when you have a bunch of pedals with inputs that vary from top to side.  I hate it when the patch isn't long enough and I have to mis-allign my pedals !  Anyway, thumbs up.  Will revisit my review if they begin to fail soon-"
1,5,I've used this to connect several devices and the colors help. I would recommend this and the quality is good.
1,5,"Good quality, seem durable enough. Sure there are better cables out there, but for the price, these are hard to beat."
1,5,"Good deal on this package of patch cords. They work just as well as the more expensive ones I have used. I like the length too. It is long enough to make a loop in, which make everything easier to work with."
1,5,"These patch cords work like a champ.  I use them with my pedal board, and haven't any issues with signal quality.  They give some versatility in their length.  I can move the cords around without having to move my pedals too much.  The colors....well...ok, they're a little odd, but for the price, I dealt with it."
1,4,"This is a simple and cheap way to hook your pedals together on your board. I have bought 2 packs of these and have only had one go bad on me. note that they are cheap and are NOT the quality of, say, George L's cables. That being said, they also don't cost $70. Can I hear a tonal difference between these cords and my more expensive ones??? Not really. People who say they hear tonal loss with some cords are scrutinizing the imagined auditory experience. Why only four stars??? because I wish they were all one color and not a rainbow of colors. it does look dorky on your board to have a bunch of different colored cords. but, that's my opinion."
1,5,"I bought these cable to use on a pedal board, and they don't disappoint. They're fairly flexible, have solid construction, and are different colors for easy identifying."
1,5,I put these on my ikea gorm board pedalboard and they work great so far.  No dead cables yet. I've been using them for 6 months or so.
1,4,"When I look down at my dirty scuffed up old pedal board and see these patch cables, so bright and festive, I just FEEL beautiful all over again."
0,3,"If you want to pay $$$ for patch cables and it somehow makes you feel more secure, go for it. Otherwise pick these up - great price and certainly gets the job done. The colors fit may into your rig or perhaps you can use them strategically, that feature is in incidental plus. They appear to be solid and will likely last just fine."
1,5,I needed some new patch cables for my board and I liked the different color thing. I believe this was part of my first order through Amazon and was totally satisfied with the process and the result . Will and have used it since. Thank you.
1,5,"These are great cables for connecting effects pedals and I love that they have a little color (both for fun & better organization). To top it all off, the price is right. Cheers."
1,5,"I bought this to add into the Axess MP1504-BLK Professional Dual Wireless Microphone I bought for home Karaoke use for my kids 6 and under. The microphone could not pick-up voice until it is about an inch close to your mouth. When you have it close to your mouth, it does sounds well enough that my kids enjoy. I added this screen to protect the microphone from getting damage or wet when it falls or when my kids touches the microphone to their mouth. Since this package came with 5 screen, I can wash it when it gets dirty and use the reserve to always have a clean microphone for my kids.The quality of the screen is very good. I believe that it can withstand abuse and will be able to handle frequent wash without ruining the material."
1,5,There is not much you can say about these other than they fit my Behringer ULTRAVOICE XM1800S just fine.  I don't sound to muffled with them on either - the colors made my Podcasting team bicker over who was getting which one.  I won't hold it against these Windscreens.
1,5,We use these on our wireless microphones and they have very vibrant color and easy for us to determine which microphone is associated with which volume dial on the amplifier.
1,4,"The product is here and I am glad the size is right. The colors punch out nice and will1. Help my vocal mics last longer so singers don't drool on my mics.and2. Help out during soundcheck. &#34;Hey, can we get blue turned down a little?&#34;Products were intact but on an quick examination I saw small tears in the foam. I will update if that matters in the long run."
1,5,"What I like about these spongy little things, besides protecting the internals of the mic, is that you can pick a color that reflects your mood according to the song you're singing. Just like a pink jail cell works to impart a sense of calm to the incarcerated, so too can a colorful mic cover. And my neighbor kids just love 'em during our singalongs!"
1,4,"I ordered this Capo on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday. I had never used a Capo of this design so I was a little skiptical but I figured with the price, I might as well give it a try. This thing works great. There is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar. The spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board. I have only used Kyser Capos in the past but this one works just as well. Only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to, otherwise you'll get some rattling noise from the strings. Once you get the hang of placing it where you need it, it works very fast when you need to change keys."
0,3,"I'm not going to recommend this over the $15 capos. It's better if you spend the extra cash and get one that is well made. I decided to try this one out, but the construction of it makes it feel like it's going to break if I pull it too hard. And, because of that, it makes it difficult to put on the guitar neck and also to remove. But, once it's on, it works."
1,5,It does the job.  Easy to get on and off.  Seems to be sturdy and well built. Best of all the price!
1,5,Works like a capo.  Nothing much to add.  My son searched for the odd colors so he could see his capo while on stage in near darkness.
1,4,"The capo looks nice and works without any problem.  You can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff.  But the build is solid, and it looks like it will last for a long time."
1,5,"This is not my only capo, but it's my cheapest.  It works as well as other more expensive ones.  This one was a good deal through Amazon.com."
1,5,"I was looking for a decent capo, found this, and have been using for months without a problem. Cheap and works great, would recommend to any guitarist."
1,5,"Cheap, quick and easy. It serves its purpose and it was so inexpensive it's almost painful. I haven't had it break and it doesn't cause any issues with the instrument, so I'm more than content with this handy, inexpensive capo."
1,4,When just starting out one purchases equipment carefully. This capo is a good choice to start with because the quality is there. Even a professional would appreciate this capo.
1,5,"It seems like such simple concept, but so many companies cannot get it right. It's just a spring and a handle, but other companies either use cheap springs that lose tension or charge you an arm and a leg for their name brand.This one worked very well for me and at this price, I am able to have a couple extra lying around."
1,5,This is a good quality Capo. The built is similar to the ones I see at the local music stores that sells between $9 - $14. I guess they are all made by the same company and then stamped with a logo by whoever is selling it. This capo does not have any logo or stamp but it works just as good as the more expensive ones.I ordered two of this item on 03/18. Expected delivery is between April 11 - 18 as the product will be shipped from Hong Kong but I received the product on April 2nd.I used it in Acoustic Guitar and on the Ukelele without any problem.
1,5,I have used these and I noticed this capo is a cut above the rest. It snaps on and clamps down on all strings right away. I do not need to readjust during play and it stays clamped until you take it off. I would recommend this capo for play during performances and live concerts.
1,4,"I got this because of the price. As soon as I opened it, the first thing I noticed was that it feels like it's not too sturdy. I don't know if it's going to last me a while. But, it does its job. Works fine on some guitars. The neck has to be thinner, though. I have to be careful when I put it on, as well as when I remove it. I'd pay for a better one if I had to get another."
1,5,I guess 5 stars because it 100% does what it's supposed to and doesn't cost much. The width of the grip gives you more leverage which can make it easier to clamp with someone with weak hands. That being said that person probably isn't playing much guitar.
1,5,"Works really well, was a great price, and was sent to me in reasonable amount of time. The capo is a nice addition to the terrific sounds one can get with the guitar."
1,5,"Good quick change capo, strong enough so far"
1,5,"This is a great Capo.  Clamps well and quickly, the clamp handle is easy to reach and is not going to easily break (aluminum, not plastic).  I like it and it was well under the price of others."
1,5,"For 3 dollars this is a great quality capo, it works perfectly don't waste your money on a Planet Waves or Dunlop or whatever, save 10 bucks and buy this"
1,4,This is a pretty good non-expensive capo. You can spend more but this does what you need it to do.
0,3,Got these because I wanted some extra capos around.  They work fine and are a great price - they do seem to be a little hard to open (spring seems a little tight).  Good deal as back-up capos.
1,5,It was my favorite capo. Someone else also liked it though as it has disappeared from my apartment. Had to buy another one.
1,5,The Capo is made of metal and works well. It does what it is suppose to do. I would buy this again.
1,4,"A bit harder to open and clamp than my other capo, but well made. I don't think that you would go wrong!"
1,4,"This obviously is trying to copy the Kyser brand capo, and it does it pretty well. Feels a bit cheaper, which it actually is both monetary and quality wise. The cardboard insert in the package even has the &#34;lifetime guarantee&#34; but no info on where to mail it; and that's pretty hilarious that they tried to replicate that aspect, but other than that, it's a good cheap capo."
1,5,"For the price and the fast shipment (despite a notice that said it would take 2 months to ship) it is well worth the money. Does what it's supposed to do so far. I can imagine that a lot of use may eventually wear out it's springiness but for now it is working great for my needs. I don't capo too much, just getting into learning some new songs that require it so cheap was the way to go for me. I could see someone who capo's a lot might want to look elsewhere but if you're only needing something simple and cheap, look no further."
0,1,"Hi Folks! OK, this thing is cheap. That's cool. But a cheap item you can't use is money thrown away. Before buying this I had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it's too small. Well, I want to clear this up once and for all. IT IS TOO SMALL! Specifically, it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so (depending on your guitar), AND it doesn't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret, even on a skinny neck. This thing really is a puzzler. I mean, who the hell would make capos this size, especially when they could've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price? Someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid. HOWEVER, a positive from this whole mess is that I finally found a capo to use with my ukulele, and for way cheap, ha ha. But if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size, this is utter garbage. Cheers!"
1,5,"Purchased for hanging two rock-band pseudo guitars. Works great for that and for uke. Would also be OK with guitars.The nature of the hardware compensates for different thickness at the nut end of instruments and so should hold almost any guitar-like instrument within reason. The packaging is very basic - you just get the product, with no fasteners or instructions.The hanger looks good, is heavily padded and so very unlikely to harm even delicate instruments. When solidly mounted, the hanger should be able to hold fairly heavy instruments - though I did not test that.For the cost these are a smoking deal. The alternatives I purchased for my music room & heavy bass guitars cost about 2x more and are not necessarily any better functionally.As mentioned there is no included hardware, but that is a non-issue as during install you may require installation to studs or with wall-board fasteners, depending on your situation and weight of your instrument. So just plan on visiting the hardware store if you don't already have these in your shop. I used wall-board hangers for one, direct screws into joist for the other, as it happens."
1,4,This is thus far a good bargain. I have used it to hang a 12 heavy string. The arms of it adjust to neck size but when the weight of the guitar pull downward the grip tightlt. No chance of falling. There are likely better units out there but for the money this one is a steal.
1,5,I hang all my gear up in the studio with these and it's really sturdy. I can't say these are easy to get the guitar down off the wall but that's the point. I'll use a stand if I'm going to use a guitar often. I had a 230lb drummer fall into the wall where I had these baby's hung up and not one fell or almost fell.
1,5,a ver nice and powerfull product for the mans health really reccomend this item  i bough for my primo and he really loves it!
1,5,"I have a couple of old guitars I couldn't bear to part with, but seldom used.  (Ah, memories!)  I keep my everyday guitars on stands so that it is easier to practice, but these add charm to my music room/office and they work great.  The &#34;fingers&#34; will grasp the neck of most any stringed instrument and hold firmly."
1,4,"Like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa. I also have a dog with a nasty habit of having to &#34;mark&#34; everything that comes into contact with the floor. So needless to say your basic guitar stand was not an option with my $700 Dean from Hell. I had ordered this product prior to my having gotten the guitar (hoping that they would all arrive at the same time) so I was unaware at how heavy the Dean was. This one looked sturdy enough...and it would be, if it were an acoustic or lightweight/hollowbody electric.But the fact that I had to bend out the pegs just a smidge, so the end knobs won't chew up the neck when trying to access/store the guitar, had me doubting the longterm durability of this product. Don't need to come home 6 months from now & find the guitar on the floor with the headstock accross the room. It should hold up long enough for me to order the Hercules. Once I get the Hercules I'll be using this mount for my Rock Band guitar controller."
1,5,I bought this for my acoustic. Bought another one for my electric Schecter Hellraiser Solo 6. Holds my bass guitars easily as well.
1,5,I payed the $11 for this just because the tuner I have was so slow to respond I needed something new.  The response time on this is like half a second and it's super simple to use.  Keep in mind that the Snark website sells this tuner for $40 so 1/4 the cost here is definitely worth it.
1,5,This is the best tuner I've used in over a decade of playing various instruments. The design is well conceived for guitar players and the results are spot on.  Overall ease of tuning and ability to do so in a noisy environment are well worth the $14 I paid.I like the ability to change the overall tuning to different standards [e.g. Baroque or NY Philharmonic] and the included metronome is also nice to have. Perhaps the most useful feature is that this unit will tune any note; guitar players can spot check a fretted tone and other musicians can tune to C or another preferred note that some guitar tuners do not have.Mine broke where the arm connects to the back of the main unit. There is a ball and socket joint and two of the socket flanges broke. Glue and a rubber band now holds it together. I mention this so that you won't put yours in a tight exterior pocket on a gig bag or otherwise smash it into a broken state.
1,5,"I own a red, blue, and now a black one. This one is the best yet. Very easy to read."
0,2,"This isn't a terrible tuner, and for how cheap it was, it wasn't a ""ripoff"". However, it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim. When it does work, it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner. However almost all of the time it's fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing. I try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and it's the same. It also did not come with batteries, and replacement ones aren't cheap and are very hard to find. I don't think this is a terrible product due to the low price, but if you want to be taken seriously and take your own music seriously, get a real desktop tuner. A cheapo one is only 5 bucks more and you can find REAL, full sized, affordable batteries for it..."
1,5,we have to many musical instruments and this is amazing little tuner. I used it even on bass guitar and it works flawlessly.
1,5,"Ive used this on Guitars acoustic and electric, Ukuleles, Banjos, Banjo Ukeleles, Violins, and mandolins.  no issues... well except that sometimes it rattles (quietly), it doesn't effect how it works but i hate a rattling guitar.  That Just means i take it off most of the time after i tune.  That's not a bad thing as it keeps me from playing out with the Tuner clipped to the guitar the whole time, and I hate how that looks anyway.  I love the little thing.  My only complaint is that (like all other clip on tuners that i've had) it wont turn itself off if i leave it on accidentally, and will then wear out the battery."
1,5,"Having to send the first Snark SN-8 back, but the replacement, thus far, has been flawless.I made a slight adjustment to my guitar's truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot on.A couple tips to tuning a guitar: tune it like you play it. If you strum & play softly, then pluck & tune each string softly.However, most people don't play softly, so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes: they pluck each string and wait like 15 seconds till the ringing fades out, & so they are generally tuning each string as it begins ""softly"" resonating.So, in essence, what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat.To tune your guitar correctly, you really ought to pluck each string hard, like every 2 seconds and tune it that way - rather than waiting for the sound to fade out. If you do it this way, you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you're strumming the living daylight out of it!Also, please check your intonation. Your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings. You pluck your open string (hard) & tune as described above. Then you check intonation by pressing VERY LIGHTLY (with JUST the TIP of your FINGER and DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER PART of the NECK), on the same string, but 12th fret - and BOTH should be in tune the EXACT same.If they are off (12TH & open), then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment. Please don't pay someone to setup your guitar! You can do it yourself so easily. Go on u toob and search ""scott grove tuning your guitar wrong"" and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over 3,000 guitars - & he spends almost an hour explaining all the details. Also, watch his video on how to setup: adjust intonation, truss rod, action, etc.Btw, if you can't get your Snark to tune your guitar: hint - it's not the tuner's fault. The first 3 saddles (e, b, g) should look like a staircase going down. Then, your next 3 strings (d,  a, e) should also look like another staircase going down. If not, break out your philips head & tweak your intonation."
1,5,"I love this little tuner.  It's better than the unit that was bundled with my guitar, and as accurate (and easier to use) than the one on my VOX Tonelab ST.I'm planning on getting at least one more to keep in the guitar case."
1,5,"I really love this little tuner, I just keep it on the headstock of my guitar when playing & just touch up tuning if needed. Best tunerI have owned for the price.R. Joyner"
1,4,This is the new and improved Snark. The display is much more readable and after several months of use display is still bright. I found with other models that the display faded and was not renewed even with a new a battery. The only downside to this one is that the bars on the display are so thick that the string has to be more out of tune before it shows up on the screen. So the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens. However the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws.
1,5,"It's a tuner that tunes nearly as well as a rack tuner for a fraction of the cost. The fact that it looks like it's made out of Bat Armor is a huge plus. For a clip-on, you can't beat the accuracy this little unit gives you."
1,5,I had the red Snark and a couple others. This one is the best ive tried so far. No problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning. 6 stars if they had it that high.
1,5,"It's hard to find a good clip-on tuner that's accurate and visible in all situations. The Snark SN-8(B) is my favorite so far.  It's really bright, more accurate that other Snarks, and (despite other reviews saying it breaks easily) I've found it to be sturdy enough considering how flexible it is.  Again, it's a clip-on tuner so don't expect razor-sharp accuracy.  But it does a good enough job for what it is.  It's quick and convenient.  If you need something more accurate I recommend investing in a good pedal.  I've found the swivel to be a nice feature that makes it easy to see the display.  I don't typically use the metronome feature, but it's nice to have it.  Overall, my favorite Snark model and my favorite clip-on tuner."
1,5,"Not only are they inexpensive, but they hold up very well. I have a ton because I keep one on the end of each guitar. Furthermore, they are very accurate as well. SO worth it just to not have the hassle of finding a tuner every time I want to change tunings.Bottom line: Inexpensive, well-made, accurate, time-saving. Buy it now."
1,5,I have had this for quite some time now and the original battery is still going strong.  I use it maybe once a week and it tune easily and accurately on both my acoustic and electric.  Great design.  I cant see how they could improve this at all.
1,5,"Wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment.So far, works well.Sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string, but generally works great. Can tune up quickly every time."
1,4,"I love the Snark tuners but don't know that I'd call it super tight or faster than the older SN-2. I feel the display is an improvement - easy on the eyes. Hopefully, more reliable than SN-2. I've had pixels dropping out on one SN-2 that is less than a year old but have another one that is doing fine. Too soon to tell if the SN-8 will hang in there.I don't see it as a faster device than the older model and have had coupling problems with it clamped to an SG. Don't know why as it works fine with acoustics and Strat. Response time on the SG is longer than the older SN-2 model but, I haven't yet tried to understand what's going on with it. Have't tried it on bass yet but, I know that the SN-2 didn't play well with the E string open. No big deal, I just tune it at 12th fret. Could choose any note since it's chromatic. Speaking of which, playing along with a song that was pitch shifted is easier with the Snark. Tune any string to match the song and then, tune the other strings with the same displayed error.Bottom line is that it's a great tuner and it's not likely that I'll get much use out of the old Korg tuner that once balanced on my knee."
1,5,"This guitar tuner is simply AMAZING!!! I feel like I should have paid at least 50 bucks for this thing, but $13 is practically a freaking steal! The display is so nice, the quality is amazon, and this thing is beyond accurate! Never using another tuner again in my life. SNARK forever!"
1,5,"This tuner works great! I am not able to vouch for accuracy, who but the best tone person can?"
1,4,Very good for a quick tune up. Might be a little to tight for checking intonation. Very fast readout and fast on off.
1,5,"This is one great piece of equipment. Even on an unplugged electric guitar, just clamp it on the end of the guitar, and it picks up vibration for tuning easily, and tunes spot-on. Adding to that is it's convenient small size, and being unbelievably cheap price. Why spring for an expensive tuner when this does such a good job?"
1,5,"This thing is dead on the money when it comes to tuning.  It has many features I have yet to utilize, but good to know they are there if needed."
1,5,"This tuner really delivers, its inexpensive and accurate , much better than the SN1. Do not be fooled by the broader gradients on the SN 8, if you are in the green , you are in tune. SN 8 is also far more reliable, no notorious having to adjust the neck to get a reading as in the SN 1 and 2. I use mine with ukulele and guitars, and both get tuned accurately with it."
1,5,"I don't play professionally so there is no need to buy expensive pedal tuners such as Hardwire HT-6, Polytune or Korg Pitchblack.  I researched for other alternatives and decided on a ""clip on"" tuner.  I narrowed it down to 3 - Korg AW2, Snark SN-1 & Intelli IMT-900.  All 3 have a lot of positive reviews and all of them are under $20.  I visited each manufacturers' website for more information and found out about the Snark SN-8.  Snark claims that it's their best tuner yet.  If their SN-1 can go toe to toe with the others, then I would assume that their best will do even better.  I took the plunge and ordered one.  I have only 2 requirements for a tuner:1.  It should be accurate.2.  It should be fast.The Snark SN-8 delivered on both counts and more!  It came with other extras like ""tap tempo metronome"", ""super tight tuning"", ""pitch calibration"", ""transpose features"" etc.  I may not have any use for all of them right now but it's nice to have them at your fingertips.  You can use it for other instruments as well but I only use it for my guitars.  The SN-8 is small & unobtrusive.  The display is bright and easily readable and can turn any which way you like.  After tuning, I turn it off and put it back in the guitar case.  I don't like it hanging in my guitar!  Of course, it doesn't stay long because it tunes fast!  For under $20, these little tuner is all you need.....fast and accurate.  Try it, you won't be disappointed."
1,5,"I own at least 8 of these.  I use them on all of my instruments, including banjo, mandolin, guitar, and Ukelele.  For the price, they cannot be beat, and they leave a small footprint too."
1,4,"I have reviewed this before.  I like it, works really well.  I have a Lever Harp with 26 strings so I really needed something that would help me keep it well tuned.  One  hint from our son who also has one,  be careful when you &#34;twist&#34; the head, he broke the first one and had to buy another one.  I am very careful How I adjust and have had no problems."
1,5,"I love these tuners.  I have tried the intel, krog, boss, etc... and out of all of them, I like the Snark the best.  Response and visual display are awesome.  Unlike a couple of the others I've used, the Snark works well on any place on the headstock.  A couple of the other brands I had to be careful where I positioned them because they didn't respond well.  You can't go wrong with any Snark."
0,3,These tuners just seem OK to me.  I still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner.  The accuracy in my opinion just isn't there.  Still nice to have for a quick touch up while practicing.  The price is right.
0,3,"Edit: I've had to downgrade my star rating a bit, so I've revised my review- full explanation below, but in short, this just doesn't work as well for me as the SN-1.Background- I have the original SN-1 as well, and have had it for a couple years. The ball socket on the back of the tuning head broke fairly quickly when I forgot to remove it from the headstock before putting it in the gig bag (Protec Contego semi-rigid hybrid case with a little more room around the headstock than your average padded bag). I rigged a repair that has worked OK, but figured a replacement was in order. However other than the broken socket, this has been one of the best tuners I've ever used. Very quick and intuitive. Bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions. Fast response on all strings, including the low B on several five string basses. Despite what I feel is a weakness in the design (the fragile socket), I still felt so good about the functionality of the product that I ordered another, this time the SN-8(B) ""Super Tight"" tuner. I decided to go with another model in the hopes that a newer model might be a little better reinforced at the ball sockets (hence the ""super tight"", perhaps?).Out of the box, the SN-8 is almost identical to the original, save for the obvious color differences. Then clamp appears the same and doesn't seem to have any greater clamping force that I could detect. Turning it on though, the display is quite different. Basically, it is much more ""to the point"". The indicator bars either side of the center pitch (""in-tune"", dead center) are much wider and fewer, meaning a less granular and less precise display, but one that is very easy to read at a glance in any light. This could be a mixed blessing, but the up side is it is brighter, simpler, and potentially quicker for on the fly tuning. The downside is it is not granular enough to say, intonate an instrument's bridge. It also seems to respond much quicker, which I am realizing is also mixed blessing, and here we have the missing star. The speed also means it responds really quickly to all input, meaning it seems to want to constantly change the note it is sensing. It seems much more twitchy than the sn-1. Unless you are able to mute every other string fully, it will jump between notes frequently. This is also one of my (many) complaints about the Planet Waves Mini-Headstock Tuner too.  I've found that attempting to tune with loud background music or other instruments blasting through a PA will cause my instrument to vibrate at other frequencies - even if I successfully mute all other strings, making tuning with the SN-8 that much more difficult. The differences here between the SN-8 and SN-1 are quite noticeable. For that reason, I just ordered another SN-1.I can't say how this tuner would work for other instruments, as I am a bass player. I'm not sure there is or isn't a defect or flaw here, perhaps it just didn't live up to my expectations (set high by my awesome experience with the original). Simply put, my sampling size is too small to say for sure or proclaim this a bad product.  All I know is that it just isn't working very well for me. If I saved the packaging for this one, I may consider sending it back in exchange for a second SN-1 or perhaps another model. If not, it'll probably be the one I hand others when they want to borrow my tuner ;)"
1,5,"I was hesitant to purchase this, as I really like the display of the previous models. At first it seems like it might be less accurate. It has less granularity in the display for example. However, it does seem to respond noticeably faster. It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes. And it may in fact be more precise, though it takes learning how to work with the display.On earlier Snarks, the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note. And they seemed pretty dead on, especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string. But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over-tune. (Though once you get used to it, it is easily avoided.)Anyway, on this unit, I am not sure what each bar represents, but it is very sensitive. If the string is not quite perfect, the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit up, but so will one next to it. Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on. Then only the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit (unless you turn too far). And the result sounds really right. I think I'll be putting one of these on most instruments from now on."
1,5,"I love this thing.  It quickly and accurately allows for tuning on any instrument I own (electric & acoustic guitars, electric & acoustic bass guitars).  It clips on securely, is easy to see, stays out of the way from my playing hands and is a breeze to turn on & off.  From the front, you can barely notice it at all.  I just leave it on my instrument all the time and use it as needed.  When I switch to another instrument I un-clip it and take it with me to what ever I want to play next.I love this thing.  Love it, love it love it!"
1,5,"If an initially unfavorable opinion changes, I owe it to the maker to say so, so I'm saying so!For me, the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used.It's not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down. In many cases, they jump around until, by the time they settle down, the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers. So, a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved.As far as the SN-8 is concerned...WRONG!I've found the SN-8 to, in fact, be Super Tight, BUT one has to insure that there isn't even a HINT of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar.This is what I don't like about the other type of Snark display.  It's not symmetric!  It requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green, and none of the yellow bars to be lit.  If the rad bars are illuminated constantly, how can you tell if the string is a hair flat?  When I'm on pitch I want *all* indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish.In that regard, the image shown here is wrong! It shows the Super Tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with Green and even a yellow. Uhm...no.The SN-8 is Super Tight, has a touch metronome, and lets you set it down a few semi-tones if that's what floats your boat and, as they say on TV, ""All for an incredibly low price!""I keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag, just in case.  At this price, I already have a half dozen Super Tights with two more on the way."
1,4,"I've been playing long enough to remember when &#34;small&#34; electronic tuners were the size of a paperback book and had prices approaching $100.  New tuners like the Snark SN-8(B) are a joy in comparison.  The display is good sized and easy read (without my reading glasses) and the tuner responds quickly and accurately.  The only complaint I've heard about this tuner is that the clamp is tight.  Yeah?  So?  It won't fall off while you're using it (or playing) and you shouldn't leave anything clamped to your guitar when you aren't using it anyway.  You can't beat the price for a tuner this easy to use and it comes with a cleaning/carrying bag too.  I've used it with standard and altered tunings on guitar, bass, banjo, mandolin, ukulele, and tipple.  This one works.One suggestion for any younglings reading this: take it from an old f*** - electronic tuners are great, especially for tuning back stage or in other places where it isn't quiet but please, do yourself a favor, and learn to tune by ear.  I've met too many young players that cannot tune a guitar without an electronic tuner.  If the battery dies they are tone deaf.  Trust me, the ability to tune by ear is a skill you will always use.  If a string goes sharp or flat while I'm playing I can tune it back without stopping.  I would not be able to do that if I hadn't learned to tune by ear."
0,3,"No, this tuner is NOT super tight. It's ok, but not super tight. I bought this because the tuner in the RP1000 is pretty sloppy. Based on owning this for a couple of weeks, I would say that it is just about as sloppy as the RP1000. I will use it on stage, but for recording I will stick to the app on my phone. Oh yeah, I almost forgot -- when you register the tuner you get a PDF download of ""Secret Chords The Pro's Don't Know"". It's good for a laugh.Pros: Bright easy to read display, fast response timeCons: Nowhere near what I would call super tight.Bottom line: Save your bread and get something else if you need a tight tuning. I would suggest the Snark SN-1. It's cheaper and works very well!"
1,5,This is very accurate and also very easy to use. The led is easy to see in well lite area as well as dark area. I loved the price.
1,4,"I will keep my review short as there have been MANY factual and well written reviews for the various Snark tuners over the years.  Quickly though, I will start by also agreeing that for the price, it is hard to beat.  This is mostly why I have given it 4 stars and just bought a sixth one.  It is accurate, reliable for tuning, and affordable.  All that said, here is why I decided to write a review.  I have owned about 5 of these Snarks and every single one has broken after about 3-4 months use.  The unit itself is great.  Here is the problem.  Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to it's own clip is where this little gem falls short.  Sure, if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home, it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky.  However, if you travel with it, take it on or off a few guitars a day, or frequently adjust it, it will likely eventually break.  Either the ""rubber feet"" that come into contact with the head stock of the guitar will come off and get lost or the little ball joint that connects the tuner's head to the clip part will break.  Best to get several of these at this great price and just keep one on each of your guitars.  One for the electric, one for the acoustic, etc.  This item does not travel well and is best used at home gently."
1,5,Love this little tuner. I have several reds and several blues and this one seem to be about the same except the displays seems to be more accurate.
0,2,"Tried this and was not happy. Seemed to want to be off too much. Got the Fender FT-004 instead. This one does have a great view on the LED, but if it doesn't tune right, what's the point? I would try the Fender. Just a note. if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner. I would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing. Just a thought."
1,5,"The Snark SN-8(B)Super Tight All Instrument Tuner is the best Snark tuner I've purchased, of 4 models. This SN-8, has a matte type finish, not glossy, it has a gun metal black look to me which I prefer to the glossy finished models. The dial, is easy to read, the bars on the dial are bold. All Snark Tuners are a great value, they function as well as any brand."
0,1,"I have had 2 of these tuners (you'd think I'd learn after one).  They calibrate okay , it's just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device (both of mine broke this way).  To me, for the price, it's made cheaply.  Try D'Addario instead; love their tuners."
1,5,"If your looking for a great, fast and accurate tuner for your guitar or bass, this is the one for you. It is easy to see in light or dark venues, has great build quality, and helps to tune your instrument in record time. I don't go anywhere without it, it may well be the last tuner you'll ever need.Flaws are few. The battery life could be better and it wont work with acoustics(no built in mic), but then you know that before you buy it, so you cant really complain. It would just be nice if it included one is all.All told, if you need a great tuner, look no further, this is one of the best, especially for the price paid. Why are you still reading this?? Buy it already ;-)"
1,5,"This clip on tuner by Snark is fantastic, works great!  It alows you to fine tune each string.  Buy it!"
1,5,I have four Snarks and one other brand.  The Snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display.  Tuning is quick and simple.
1,4,"This is the third Snark tuner (the others were Snark II) I have bought. Both of the others broke where the stem joins the clock-type display (could be glued together, but irritating). This one seems to be made of different material and with a bit of luck will be more durable. Why buy this after the experience of the others? Well they are very good and easy to use tuners, and for not much money (my guitar strings cost more!). This one has a great display - full colour and easy to read. I use it on a guitar, a bass and a 12 string and it works well on all of them."
1,5,"A i'm very impress with the precition of this tuner. It's very light and can adjust very easily on both electric and acoustic guitar. (even using a capo) 100% recommended.Battery is included also, so you can use it right out the box."
1,4,"The display is very readable but you have to be looking atit from a near perpendicular angle.  Maybe I'm using it wrong but Ihave trouble finding anywhere to clip it but my pegs.  But from there it works great,just have to work to find a peg at the right position to afford a  good angle."
1,5,"Easy, accurate and, best of all, it swivels to any position and stays upright for easy viewing. I've tried other brands and they don't swivel correctly."
1,5,The Snark tuners are very accurate and the price on this could not be beat!  Great tuner.  I got about three of them!
1,5,"I had to get used to this tuner at first.  I have used a different brand up until this purchase.  An experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me.  Glad he did, the price is way affordable on this site and it's really easy to use!"
1,5,I clipped it on the neck (head) of my acoustic guitarIt tunes up well and is very easy to readI turn it off after tuning but leave it on the guitar while playingI have not used it enough to test the battery lifeBut so far so good. Great for the price.All Pros and No Cons so far
1,5,"This is a very useful tuner since it's small, fast and pretty rugged.  I've dropped mine several times with no damage to the rubbery-like casing.  I have an older model that I still use, also."
1,5,"Small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little. I wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my Sony and Korg plug in tuners. It clips onto the guitar easily, stays put, and is not intrusive by weight or size. The bars are easy to see and are accurate."
1,5,I personally use this in conjunction with my TU-3 on the ground but honestly it just gets a read faster than the TU sometimes and it's a fraction of the cost. Really efficient way to go in my opinion. I am a pit orchestra musician and I've lent it to people who play LOTS of different instruments and it really tends to work well with all of them.
1,5,"Great tuners, Ive had the snark 1s i think (the blue ones) and they were really good the rubber part always fell off. It is too early to tell if this will last longer but so far so good"
1,5,"This is the newer version of the original Snarks. I have bought the red, blue and older black models. These are great. Fast and reliable, and accurate. This new ""Super Tight"" is a bit faster and is slightly more accurate than the others, but the older units are still excellent. The display is a little brighter, but I think the battery life is a little less than the originals. I can't recommend these enough."
1,5,"This tuner does a great job tracking notes rather quickly, and I've enjoyed using it.  It does its job, and it's well worth the money."
1,5,"For $13, its hard to say anything bad about this gadget. It's accurate in any sound environment, easy to read in any light, very portable, and will tune any stringed instrument. The visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that's a silly extra that doesn't interfere with anything so no problem."
1,5,"This is hands-down the best tuner I've *ever* owned. The Snark SN8 works extremely well, and being chromatic, works on every stringed instrument I own (guitar, bass, banjo, violin) no matter what key the instrument is tuned to. I still use my Korg Pitchblack inline with my bass (also a very nice product), but that is mainly to get more cord length across the stage and still keep my signal strong. This little baby is amazingly easy to use, and always accurate. It has a nice bright easy to read display in any lighting situation and makes tuning a breeze and not a hassle (just as it should be - I've personally always hated those Boss pedal tuners). It simply does its job and does it very well.Also, buying this item from Amazon saved me quite a bit over the local Guitar Center, which is always a big plus. It feels tough too, this thing feels like it can easily handle the rigors of being tossed around, which is a very good thing. Despite the flimsy way the seller packaged this for shipping, the product arrived intact, and fast. I would have cropped a star for a damaged product in that little wimpy envelope they sent it in. Fortunately mine arrived in perfect condition (no thanks to that paper envelope - seriously, they should use a stiff cardboard envelope or small tube or something).I could not be happier, at least until I buy another one to keep at the house while the first stays in my gig bag."
1,5,"I bought this for a friend who's previous tuner was lost. I have to say... I've been so impressed by how easy this is to read, that I'll probably buy one for myself now.Other than a great display and accurate tuning... this is made with a move-able arm between the tuner and the clip. The arm is a dual ball joint and allows you to configure this is any position you'd like.I wasn't expecting it to be this nice. Very cool!"
1,4,I used it about twice and so far it is a good product I also use it to check sync with my other tuners
1,5,"I would say as long as you dont try to use this as a floorjack, it will work just fine for you. I dont wrench the arm around like all star wrestling and it appears to work fine for me. I love the way it sits right on top of the headstock and you can tune instantly. Nice and bright, easy to see.  Had it about 4 weeks now and on all of my guitars. Remember its a guitar tuner, not an impact wrench."
1,5,I read some mixed reviews about the unit but I&#8217;ve not noticed anything abnormal with mine. Seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price.
1,5,"I've tried so many other strings over the years just to see if I was missing something. I wasn't. There's something about the feel and tone of Ernie Ball Regular Slinkys that I absolutely love. My local music store has 3 for the price of 2 deal on strings, which is a nice deal; however, this deal is a little sweeter. If you can wait for the delivery, it's a no brainer."
1,5,"Something about EB Strings, they really are ""slinky"" - whatever that means. They have a cool vibe and make my guitars sound better.  Plus they are a little easier on the fingers than the other big brands."
1,5,Ernie Balls strings at a great price - nothing more to say
1,5,"I've been using these strings on all my guitars, electric and acoustic, since the mid-70s.  I've tried many others, but always come back to Ernie Balls.  They tune better and they keep the ""new strings"" sound longer and that's the main plus, but they just ""feel"" good.  I play and practice a lot and I abuse strings...these can take it and come back for more!"
1,5,"I recently got myself a Kenny Wayne Shepherd Stratocaster guitar, I decided that since the guitar he had a set of tens strings installed I would go with these.They work flawlessly.The qualities excellent cannot go wrong with Ernie Ball strings no matter what gauge you get."
1,4,I got this for our church. I got sick of seeing the guitars against the wall. They where very easy to put together and now the guitars are off the wall and sitting on the stands perfectly.
1,5,"Musician's Gear Tubular Guitar Stand Black Pair is a good deal for musician. Buy it, if you would like to have your guitars ready to play anytime you want to."
1,5,I'm happy with them. SO much easier having my guitars in a stand i can grab when I want. These stands are decent quality and pretty reasonably priced.
1,5,very happy. Holds my lies Paul and schechter guitars very well. Had a bit of a chemical smell when first opened.
1,5,"These are solid stands for holding your guitars. I use them with my six string acoustic and my six string electric guitars and they work great. They are an excellent value.The reason they are so important to have is that, by having your guitars out and available to play, you will get more practice. They help me pick up my guitars much more often. Instead of dragging out the case and getting a single 20 minute session, I might get 4 or 5 10 minute sessions a night -- more on the weekends.Stands of this quality were about three times the cost at my local music store. I highly recommend these for around the house use."
1,4,Cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far. I've taken them from new jersey to south carolina
1,4,"I bought a couple of these two years ago. They are a sturdy but lightweight stand. The small footprint is nice for those with limited space. I use for both electric and acoustic guitars. I will say that the two I recently purchased are NOT the same as the ones purchased in 2011. The pictured product is the same but the actual product is not. The newer stands have a rear leg that is about half the length as the older model. The tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support. The body support now inserts through the base tube; the earlier design had a reinforced tube that accepeted the body support piece. The rubber feet are also smaller. These changes appear to make the newer stand less sturdy and stable, however I believe the stand will be adequate for most full size guitars. I didn't notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported. There may be a concern about damage to certain finish. I would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material."
1,5,I needed to have a place to sit my guitars and bass. These things work really great. I love them.
1,5,"I'll echo what others have said: this is a superbly built instrument for the price, and I don't know how Epiphone can make them to sell so inexpensively. It looks, feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as much.A few notes: what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the &#34;Vintage&#34; model is actually a super-rich deep, deep mahogany/maroon color, and it's unbelievably beautiful.As others have said, the factory-supplied strings are crap; if you judge the instrument by them, you'll be disappointed. Include a set of Aqila Nylgut strings when you order this ukulele, and restring it as soon as you get it.I was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my $60 Kala soprano uke--normally, one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder, fuller sound. But the Les Paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an all-acoustic ukulele, and that probably accounts for the quieter tone. I think it's a *better* tone, and I'm more interested in delicacy than in loudness, so I'm happy with it. If I wanted stadium-filling volume, I could always plug this into a stack of Marshall amps.Oh, I almost forgot one important note to all owners: IT IS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE STUPID, UGLY PICK GUARD! Since ukulele players rarely use picks, and when we do, we use soft rubber or felt ones, there's no need to protect the finish from scratching, and that white pick guard really detracts from the instrument's looks.I applied gentle heat from a hair dryer on its low power setting for about ten minutes, and very slowly and gently pried up the edges of the pick guard with my fingernails--no sharp tools! It came off pretty cleanly, leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue. I was able to get rid of those with small amounts of rubbing alcohol on cotton, without any damage to the luscious ultra-glossy lacquer finish. And the ukulele looks SO much better now! If you feel as I do, feel free to do likewise. Just remember the key words: SLOW and GENTLE. Don't force anything, and you should be fine."
1,5,"Upon arrival, I was astonished. With a box as monstrous as the one this little number arrived in, I was expecting a ukulele made for Andre the Giant.It's not quite as big as the packaging leads one to believe but the sound sure is!The unplugged tone is warm and sweet, like the most delightful brownie you could ever imagine. Plugged in it really shines. I paired mine with a Pignose 7-100 for street performing and, while it is a bit too chilly to play for nickels at the moment, I have no doubt this will pay for itself in the long run.I was slightly surprised at how slim the body is (similar in scale to an actual Les Paul), as I was expecting a fuller body but it doesn't hurt the playability a bit.The finish is gorgeous and the little stick-on pickguard is just too adorable for words.If you're hemming and hawing over getting one, just do it. You'll be oh so pleasantly surprised."
1,5,"I recently purchased this ukulele from a local Guitar Center. When i first got there i was looking at the Lanikai brand, but when i picked it up it was so light and thin that I felt like a strong wind could tear it apart. Then I saw this one. It has a little bet of weight and had a fuller sound than the other ukes in my price range. I have already learned the basic chords and can't wait to become proficient with this instrument."
1,4,"I enjoy playing this thing so much. It's reasonably quiet acoustically, but it shines when plugged in. Plus is looks good - the actual color and finish are quite rich and shiny, respectively.It stays in tune (after string break-in) and the intonation is ok - not spot on but definitely good enough. The tuners are basic, but they work well. It is thinner than a normal uke, about half the body depth. I find holding it without a strap to be harder than a normal sized uke, but with a strap it's very comfortable.Mine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket. The bag itself is also pretty basic, but good enough for what it is - a bag to hold your uke and some misc. items"
1,5,"This is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds! Change the strings immediately, and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument.  Amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too!Only drawback - there is no volume control on the instrument itself.The amp cable that is included is nothing to write home about, and the gig back is a cheap nylon deal - BUT, it's all about the instrument, and I give that a 5."
0,3,"The action was a little high for my taste.  The strings are not good and need to be replaced as soon as possible. Why do they sell an instrument with crap strings? That is a total mystery to me because it really detracts from the initial impression of the instrument.  Otherwise it's well built and works.  Really it's a three and a half star IMO, it's not as nice sounding or as playable as my Mahalo hardbody which was about the same cost and came set up with perfect action and with aquila strings."
1,5,"My wife was worried about what to get me for Christmas, I really didn't want anything (other than the Harley I have been asking for for 25 years, maybe next???) and while surfing Amazon I came across this Les Paul. I had to laugh since it looks so much like my Gibson Les Paul, kind of like a ""Mini Me"" version.Well I have never heard of a Les Paul Uke and did not think for $99 that it would be much...but the reviews were telling a different story. So I found my Christmas present at last for ""the man who has everything"" (it is true, my wife told me...still hoping for that Harley though). I ordered it a few days before Christmas so it would not be under the tree much to my wife's dismay...but I printed a photo of it and framed it then wrapped it up and placed it under the tree anyway. Well Christmas came which means it was also one day closer to getting the real thing (the Uke, not the Harley), but everyone had a laugh at my shocked expression and obvious glee when I opened up my framed photo of my soon to be baby Les Paul!I figured since I was taking my fellow Amazonian's word I better order some Aquila Ukulele Strings since everyone stated that the ones that came with the Uke are junk(and they are, shame of Epiphone) which I did, the Uke arrived about 4 days before the strings but I attempted to learn how to play it anyway.....OUCH those stock strings were rough on the fingers, and the sound left much to be desired so I waited until the new string were installed prior to this review.Wow with the new strings it is totally like a different instrument, it now sounds as good as it looks and sooooo much easier on the ole fingers. I just love it now!!!!So if you decide to get one of these Mini Me Les Paul's do yourself a favor and get.......A set if Aqila stringsAquila USA Aquila Concert Ukulele StringsA Snark Uke Tuner SN-6Snark SN-6 Ukulele TunerA nice leather guitar strapFender Plain Leather Guitar Strap With Fender Logo, BlackandA Daily Ukulele Song Book by Jumpin JimThe Daily Ukulele: 365 Songs for Better Living  [DAILY UKULELE] [Paperback]You will love all of these items I am sure.When it arrives be sure to practice ""Billie Jean"" played by Jim Hill...see it on YouTube...it is a riot![...]orJake Shimabukuro Bohemian Rhapsody[...]Enjoy!"
1,5,"I really don't see how Gibson can make and sell these for $99!  The tech at the guitar shop can't see how either.  I plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects.  I was really surprised to see how well they sounded.  I'm not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy/experiment for me.  If you are really into electric sound, I recommend going the guitar route.  If you just want to play around a little, this uke will do."
1,5,"* SHIPPING.  The Epiphone comes wrapped in  protective foam, inside a gig bag, which is inside a sturdy standard tri-shaped box, which is itself shipped inside a HUGE box twice its size and totally surrounded by sturdy bubble plastic.  That huge box is then inside yet ANOTHER huge box.  Honestly, to protect this better they'd have had to contact Tony Stark.  It would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping.  EXCELLENT job.  5 stars on that alone.* SIZE. Overall length 24"".  Fretboard 10"".  Nut to bridge 15"".  So good overall medium-size.  I like that it's a bit larger than a 20-21"" soprano uke.  It is ""concert"" size (which I greatly prefer over soprano.  Frankly, I'd like to see a baritone version).  The 24"" length is an excellent size for both adult and youth / child fingers.* QUALITY.  From stern to port, this instrument shines.  Beautifully lacquered flawless finish, protective edging, plastic finger-guard (which itself was guarded in adhesive plastic), solid neck screw-joined to heavy-wood body.  The whole unit is heavy-wood and very durable.  Nevertheless the sound is quite good.  The tuners are acceptable quality (nothing amazing, but they work well).  The frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes.  The amp-jack is chrome-metal back-plated to the body; it's NOT coming loose.  Strap holders are already mounted, saving users the hassle.  And of course, the impressive EPIPHONE and LES PAUL signature stamps on the head for sheer class.* SOUND.  I found this to sound as good as most ukes right out of the box, despite the fact it's pretty solid-wood electric (I expected it to sound dull.  It doesn't.)  But I still bought a set of d'Addario strings (a brand I've loved for years) and according to other reviews here expect the sound to improve significantly once those are added.* ACTION. I've rarely seen a purchased instrument that has perfect action off the shelf and this is no exception. The action is fairly high (not uncommon with off-the-shelf instruments).  One will need to remove the strings (keep them for emergency spares), file down the bridge bottom (easily done with a flat surface and sandpaper) and add a new set of quality strings.  I'm a perfectionist when it comes to action (as are most players I know), so this will be tweaked.* DURABILITY.  It's very durable.  That counts for the gig bag too.  No cheap ""tent nylon"" there-- but thick nylon that will really resist tearing.  As others mentioned I'd still look for a decent hard case; they average under $40.  A good instrument is worth protecting.  But I'd say this could take some real punishment and still play well-- not that I'd go bashing it against a stage floor.  That would be goofy.* WEIRD SUGGESTION:  Hang on to the box it comes in.  It makes a great temporary ""hard shell"" case. It's made of rather sturdy cardboard and does a pretty good job of protecting the uke.  Great for hauling around in your car if you can't shell out for a shell. Seriously... that is some stiff cardboard.  Protects well.  : )* ELECTRONICS.  The sound is clear. Sadly there is no volume/tone control, no battery to preamp, and thus the signal to the amp was quite low.  They could have done better on that end.  But wow, at this price how can one gripe?Two solutions to this:1) Open up the end plate and totally replace the electronics with something better (including a tone and volume knob somewhere accessible).  That's the tricky way.2) Put a preamp on this. You can buy one here on Amazon for about 15 bucks. If you have a mini-mixer you can do the same thing with that.  Even with that little extra expense you'll come out ahead.Aside from the passive electronics... this is a PRIME instrument.  It is a mid-size uke so you can choose to string it either as a soprano (if you're careful and don't tune it too quickly) or a baritone (guitar 4th - 1st string, E-high), depending on the strings you choose.Considering what you get for the price... I don't think this can be beat.  Unfortunately, my extra-long fingers find this very difficult to play... something I didn't consider when ordering a uke.  But that's a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument.  The product itself is excellent."
1,5,This is a great deal for two microphone stands.  They are well constructed and are very flexible; can be used with an instrument or just as an ordinary microphone stand.  Several adjustment areas allow the perfect height/positioning.  These should last a long time as long as they're not abused.
1,5,"These are solid, good build quality and really do get the job done well.Easily adjustable, versatile in design and function, get em!"
1,5,"I bought these as back up stands and now use them all the time, they perform just as good as the better stands and I liked the 2 pack value... Nice..."
1,4,"This microphone stand it a fairly good buy.  Because it is a light and portable stand, it is not built to be fully extended with microphones, such as the Behringer XM1800S.  Adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone.  I found that I needed to line up one of the legs directly under the boom when it was fully extended.  As it stands, I would suggest this as a fairly good deal."
1,5,"Received these with lightining speed! They came heavily guarded in boxes so shipping is less likey to mess them up. Alot of adjustments to these, and they actually adjusted high enough for me at 6'5"" to be able to sing at Lemmy's angle! Great for singing, micing amps and such. These are 39.99 each at a local music store so....Update: These are perfect for micing amps or for use as a drummer's mic, but if you grab it with some enthusiasm, the plastic part the mic attaches too will separate and the whole thing will come off in your hand. I used clear epoxy on both and have yet to have any more trouble like that. I still say they are good for the price, just need a dab of glue to ensure no incidents happen."
1,5,"I expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had.  To be honest, I'm not missing anything.  They have all the features and versatility you'll ever need.  Perfect for what I want to do.  They even come with a clamp for your cable."
0,3,"Some of the stands I have purchased are hollow, some are solid (at the part that screws together to adjust the height of the stand). The hollow ones are a PITA because they are easier to strip and bend. All mic stand inventories I have bought from (budget lines) have this issue. I wish they would specify exactly what you are going to get in your box."
0,2,"I know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here.  The unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a RODE M1 mic or similar.I knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot, but I opened one, tried to use it and can't. It was a total waste of money, but doesn't pay to return it.  I suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it, it might serve your purpose.  Again, you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands."
0,1,"The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately.  Replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand.  They are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting, good enuf okay I guess.  But after transporting and reset, I found them to be junk."
1,5,I got these recently. A local Music shop was wanting $80 per stand so couldn&#8217;t believe the price of these. Was expecting cheap and very plastic and was very pleasantly surprised. Great quality an very robust.
1,5,"I didn't know when I ordered these mic stands that they were On Stage stands. They are fully adjustable, great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics. Excellent quality. I'm very happy with this set."
1,5,I wanted P-90 pickups. They do make noise kind of like an old album. Once you start playing you don't notice it though. Other than that the guitar stays tuned and is a blast for a beginner like me to bang around on. It looks really good!
1,5,"I am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar.  I have learned a few songs, but I still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar.  I wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap.  I had the Dean Electric Guitars in the past and a Fender Acoustic a while ago.  The Fender and the Dean's were very nice.  I thought the Dean's had a very nice sound to them and so did the Fender.  This guitar has a very nice sound to it as well.  I couldn't figure out the different tunings on it though.  It said Rhythm and Treble and then just regular in the middle.  I kept it on the regular because it sounded normal.  The other one's must be for some special type of music.  But this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the Dean's.  It is also very easy to hold unlike the Dean's I have found.  The Dean's also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and I have not found one on this guitar which is a plus.  But this is a very nice beginner's guitar if your just looking to get started.  I would stay away from those Fender knockoff's and stuff like that and get this guitar.  I also got the cheap Rogue amp to use with it and it sounds great, plenty loud enough if not too loud sometimes.  All in all, a very nice bargain."
1,5,"I have owned this guitar for about 2 years now, and it still has a great sound and is very playable, especially for the money. It stays in tune very well even though the tuners do seem a little cheaper than Epiphones I've owned in the past... but hey, they work so why change them? The overall fit and finish of the guitar is excellent for the price point, and mine has the flat black finish which hides fingerprints very well. The neck is fast and smooth and great for quick playing. The single coil p90 style pickups on this guitar scream with their own beautiful raw sound, and were the reason I bought this guitar. Take note that p90's do make a humming sound when you're not playing, which can be remedied by turning down the volume knob. This is why humbucker style pickups were invented, but the compromise of a humbucker is you lose a lot of the bite and energy that p90's give you. It really has the sound of a higher dollar guitar. I currently play it through a Fender Vibro Champ tube amp and this combo really makes playing guitar fun. I recommend this guitar if you're on a budget like me, or even if you're not on a budget and want a p90 equipped guitar in your stable."
1,5,"As a gigging musician and guitar player for over 25 years I am always in the hunt for something different. I love Fenders especially telecasters (I love the simplicity of two pickups, two knobs, and a p-up selector). I wanted something with P-90s and have been impressed with budget level guitars as of late. You can get a lot more for your money these days.I pulled the trigger on one of these Les Paul Special P-90 by Epi and have been really impressed. I actually bought it as a modification platform but as of yet, I can't really think of anything to change.Pros - Simple, TV yellow is great looking with wood grain showing through, Shorter scale has that familiar Les Paul feel. Sounds KILLER through my tube amps (Peavey Classic 30 and 50, Fender Blues Jr.), lightweight, stays in tune, cheap price (not afraid to take it out to a gig, not afraid to have it stolen, let my kids play it, etc.), comfortable neck profile.Cons - Cheap tuners (but stay in tune), cheap electronics (wiring), some frets are long and sharp (my high E string gets caught under the 14th/15th fret - I haven't filed it yet), messy job at nut and fret board.All in all, this is a great guitar for a great price. I still plan on modding it, but as it stands it is perfect with all its imperfections. My upgrades, if any, will be new pots, caps, wiring, nut, perhaps tuners. No need to replace these pickups. You get to a certain point of diminishing returns when modding a cheap guitar like this. At a certain point your cost of upgrades will exceed the cost of the instrument.As a bit of a guitar snob (love my US Fenders) this guitar is getting a lot of action. I say this one just may be a keeper."
0,2,"Big disappointment. I've been so impressed by Epiphone's but this one didn't do it. Quality of manufacture and assembly great. Pickups far less than inspiring. Yes, it's a great platform but was so expecting those P90 sound. I may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it. Just didn't have the tone and bite I was expecting.I could certainly invest in some PUP's but I have too many great P90 guitars to bother. Roll of the dice I guess."
1,5,"I have spent a good month with my new guitar, and I am impressed. The pickups don't suck, the potentiometers are surprisingly good, the tuners are not very good, but I can live with them. The fretwork was second to none, absolutely the best fretwork I've seen in a guitar under $500. The 60's neck profile is very fast and comfortable, and it's a satin finished neck and body (unfinished fretboard). It's also not a very heavy guitar (considering that it's a mahogany body and neck). My main issue with this guitar is that the wraparound bridge/tailpiece breaks wound strings easily. I have gone through 4 6th, and 2 5th strings in the single month I have owned this guitar. Upgrade it to something better. Your strings will thank you. Oh, and (this goes without saying) UPGRADE THE STOCK STRINGS!"
1,5,"These were just what I needed.  Over the years, some of the bridge pins on my 12-Sttring Acoustic Guitar have broken and had to be replaced.  Some of them had the white dot, some didn't, therefore, they didn't look uniform.  With these pins, the guitar now looks like it did when I bought it.  Thank You. James Edward(BAT)Owens"
1,5,"I just recieved these in the mail today, and these seem to be much better quality than the original pegs in my guitar! Not much else to describe, they're fairly simple to use, and they're selling you 12 of them, so I have a spare set now! My original pegs were also white, on an all black guitar, so I'm totally excited for the new look these pegs give my guitar. I definitely recommend these for anyone that needs/wants black pegs for their acoustic, or acoustic/electric gutiar."
1,4,"Good for the price, but  If you can spend a few dollars more, I would recommend the graph tech ones."
1,5,"good quality plastic and attractive and cheap replacement for any acoustic guitar, slotted with taper and fits well in my bridges"
1,4,"they did the job.  they're plastic.  they didn't cost much.  fit my 12 string with no problems.  they aren't bone, brass, wood, pearl, don't expect them to be."
1,5,I love this tuner! Its awesome to use and efficient! The only thing I wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are. To my ear it sounds good but you never know???
1,5,"This is my new favorite tuner. Not only can you just clip it to the head of your guitar and leave it there permanently, it works like a champ. I don't mean that it works, I mean that it works better than any of my other tuners. It is SUPER tight. It recognizes pitch differences that my ear can't, leaving a better tune than my RP255 or any of the old cheap korg tuners and the like I've got laying around.I plan on buying these for all my guitars."
1,5,"this tuner works great.  it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning.  I use mine all the time between different alternative tunings.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my grandson who is learning to play guitar as well.  a great investment unless you have a perfect ear."
1,4,"I purchased two Fender instruments, a mandolin and an acoustic guitar, each of which came with a Fender clamp-on tuner with similar functionality, but I thought to give the Snark a try. I haven't used the sound versus vibration mode much, nor have I done much with the metronome function much--I can't speak to them; however, I am very pleased with the vibration tuning. Compared to the Fender, both will get your strings tuned well; what I like better about the Snark is there is a almost no dwell from the last note stuck before the next note registers. With the Fender, I feel I have to wait a few seconds for the screen to clear before striking again, and that adds up when moving from string to string.  The Snark is bulkier in the soft gig bag; the trade-off is any easy-to-read display. Lately, it's become my go-to tuner."
1,5,"This is not just a tuner - its a peacekeeper for our band.  Arguing over tuning can really take up time.  It works so good everyone in our acoustic string band is required to have one attached!  I do kind of miss the fights over who's in tune and who's flat, though.  Excellent product, though the metronome is of no value, but that's not important.  We use it for guitars, violins, violas, cello, bass guitar, voice training, and ordering pizza (who ever is out of tune pays the pizza bill)."
1,5,"A great little amplifier.  Good quality, good built in effects, and is still easy to carry around.  I replaced the stock speaker with an Eminence Rajun Cajun, which has improved the tone and provided increased volume. The amp is now capable of being used at small gigs. I would highly recommend."
1,5,I've been using this amp for a few months and I'm very pleased with the overall quality and performance. I was looking for a small studio amp and watched the demo video on YouTube. I ordered it through Amazon and it arrived quickly. The amp has two shades or flavors as I call it. I only use the clean side or input one. This is what Fender calls Blaceface Clean. No matter how hard you push that channel it won't break up and sounds great with no FX's running. I really haven't used channel two much. These are all your pre-sets which many amps are doing these days. I'm pretty much old school and like to find my own sound. However they do sound very good and you can change a lot of these settings both from the front panel and through your computer. The amp itself hooks right into your USB connection such as Gargeband or other recording boards or software. The amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on... It's a loud 15 watts... I have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems. If your looking for a studio/home/1st amp you can't go wrong with this guy. It's now my go to amp in the studio. You can make this amp sound many different ways and with an FX chain in front of channel one (how I run it) the sky is the limit. Haven't used the software that you need to download from Fender but will look at it later. right now this amp doesn't need to be tweaked for me...I loved it right out of the box! Give it a test drive and let your ears decide...
1,5,"This is the greatest practice amp ever.  And by practice I mean practicing by yourself and with a band.First, it's all tube, so it sounds really good.  It's gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes.  It also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast.Second, it's 15 watts and is pretty darn loud.  I've used it for band practice and it's definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer.  At a bar you'll probably need to mic it or use the included line-out.Third, if the 10&#34; speaker isn't loud enough, you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air, it sounds great in the 4x12 and 2x12 cabs I have.  That'll make it loud enough for most bars.Fourth, it has great sounding built in effects, nearly everything you'll need.  Most small tube amps don't have built in effects.  So if you're trying to practice down in the living room, you're forced to drag your effects with you.  That's annoying.  With this amp everything is built in.Fifth, unlike a lot of tube amps, this one gets very quiet.  You can turn it way down, keep the warm tone, and practice without bothering anyone else.Sixth, the price is amazing.  All tube, build in effects, and line and speaker out... wow.  Fender is basically giving these things away.I love this amp so much I want to buy one for every guitarist I know.  The only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch.  But considering the price, that's understandable. There's no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them.  You'll only want the cover and footswitch if you're playing in a band."
1,5,"I have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers, including a few of the Vox Valvetronix series.  However, this is both my first Fender amp, as well as my first true &#34;tube&#34; amp.  First, some clarification is needed on &#34;tube&#34; vs. &#34;modeling&#34; amp.  The Fender Super Champ X2 is absolutely a tube amp - it has one 12AX7 and two 6V6's, and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages.  However, the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone, which is what allows it to project different &#34;voices&#34;.  Contrary to what some posters have written, Channel 1 does also have some front-end modeling, except that the the model is fixed for &#34;Blackface&#34; tone and controlled by a separate volume know (no gain control).  Channel 2 offers 16 different &#34;Voice&#34; presets and 10 of these model a variety of vintage Fender amplifiers, including the Tweed Deluxe, Bassman, Deluxe, Princeton, and Twin.  Settings 9-15 model a variety of other popular amps, including the Vox AC30 and Marshall.Overall, I found the available tones to be excellent.  Unlike my Valvetronix, where I more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times, I could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars.  One thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently - you may have to adjust volume, gain, bass, and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp.  However, I found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component.  Also, the X2 does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or &#34;hissing&#34; you hear with digital modeling amps.The tones that come out of the 10&#34; speaker of the Super Champ X2 are very rich and touch-responsive, as you'd expect from a tube amp.  The amp has TONS of high-end sparkle, but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume (true of many amps).  The stock speaker, which is Fender's own design (and has a ceramic magnet, I believe), is frequently criticized as a weak point.  However, it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps (or only intend on playing at bedroom levels), you're unlikely to take issue with it.  The Eminence Ragin' Cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end.  But, again, the amp is plenty loud and full-sounding for its size.  Better intended for home/studio use than most gigs, but it excels at what it does.That brings us to the effects section and the Fender FUSE software that works with the amp via USB cable.  Frankly, I'm not a fan of most on-board effects with combo amplifiers.  I prefer to use pedals for modulation, delay, and some overdrive/distortion.  The good new is that the on-board reverbs (which include spring, room, hall, and a few others if you install them from the software) are quite good.  You can also reassign the presets to different effects.  So, if you want a flanger with a reverb, you can have a setting for that.  If you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb, you can do that too.  The Tap Tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects.  But, as I said, while they represent a good value for players that don't want to invest in pedals, I'm more likely to use my Boss DD-3 than the on-board delay, and so on.The build quality of the Super Champ X2 is largely excellent.  The grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of Fender's more expensive amps.  The amp weighs in at 24 pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top.  One thing I did note, however, is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting, so I will have to be careful about that.  Also, there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better.  But overall, the amp looks very well constructed.  I was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic, but everything is mapped to vintage-looking knobs, and from a few feet back, the amp looks just as much at home in the 60's as it does post-2000.Overall, I think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that I hope to enjoy for years to come.  I'm only really scratching the surface of its potential, but it makes great Fender tone sound easy.  The Fender FUSE software could be a little more intuitive to work with, and I wish there were a better way to know what each of the Voice and F/X settings correspond to without consulting a chart.  But it's a great little amplifier that's all the power you'd need for hobbyists and studio recording, and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well."
1,5,"This amp sounds phenomenal for such a small package and a single 10 inch speaker!  It sounds great right out of the box.The overdrive channels amp models are some of the best I've heard from modelers, pedals etc. Not much use for any of my many pedals with this amp because better tones are already in the presets and I havent even looked at the fuse software yet.I am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes.  If you mic up this will work for small gigs.  The build seems very good.I don't think you can find a better sounding brand new amp for this price."
1,5,"I picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised. The sound is very authentic as I have a 60's tube Champ in excellent working order for reference, as well as a Deville.This little amp has the classic Fender tube sound, with a broad, punchy tone and the right amount of compression. The included digital effects, (vibraphone, delay, reverb, chorus and tremolo) are all convincing and well executed.The modeling portion of the amp is also well done and includes voicing for a tweed champ, tweed deluxe clean/dirty, baseman, 65 princeton clean/dirty, 65 deluxe clean/dirty, 65 twin and an array of british and metal amps.All and all, a super practice amp or mic-able performance amp. Great job Fender.PS - I don't review products that don't stand out as excellent."
1,5,I love this tuner. It is accurate & very reasonably priced. I have ordered this tuner for  fellow musician friends & all of them love them. Best clip on tuner I have ever purchased.
1,5,"Lightweight, small, simple to use, and it's easy to read in broad daylight.Can't ask for much more in a tuner."
1,5,"Wonderful tuner, I've used it for my acoustic and my bass and have had no problems at all.  Incredibly easy to use, super cheap and easy to just throw in your case and go.  Well worth the price!"
1,5,I already had the other two Snarks and then I borrowed this version in a shop from another patron.  The readout is cool.  Makes me feel good inside to look at it.
1,5,"Will work on any instrument.  You don't need the expensive ones, this works just fine..just wish the batteries lasted longer!"
1,5,"For the money there isn't a better tuner on the market today.  This is the newer version which some have complained about the tuning lines being thicker, really?  This tuner is s[pot on every time and super fast.  You can move from string to string quick."
1,5,"The compactf design of this tuner makes it easy to take with you to lessons, school, or a gig.  Works well."
1,5,Let the testimony of my repeated purchases be your guide. the batterry that come with it lasts an average of 6 -9 months - A new battery will last over a year - I get replacements at local CVS - Savon store
1,5,"I was hesitant to purchase this, as I really like the display of the previous models. At first it seems like it might be less accurate. It has less granularity in the display for example. However, it does seem to respond noticeably faster. It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes. And it may in fact be more precise, though it takes learning how to work with the display.On earlier Snarks, the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note. And they seemed pretty dead on, especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string. But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over-tune. (Though once you get used to it, it is easily avoided.)Anyway, on this unit, I am not sure what each bar represents, but it is very sensitive. If the string is not quite perfect, the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit up, but so will one next to it. Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on. Then only the ""On pitch"" bar will be lit (unless you turn too far). And the result sounds really right."
1,5,"For me, the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used.It's not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down. In many cases, they jump around until, by the time they settle down, the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers. So, a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved.As far as the SN-8 is concerned...WRONG!I've found the SN-8 to, in fact, be Super Tight, BUT one has to insure that there isn't even a HINT of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar.This is what I don't like about the other type of Snark display.  It's not symmetric!  It requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green, and none of the yellow bars to be lit.  If the rad bars are illuminated constantly, how can you tell if the string is a hair flat?  When I'm on pitch I want *all* indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish.In that regard, the image shown here is wrong! It shows the Super Tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with Green and even a yellow. Uhm...no.The SN-8 is Super Tight, has a touch metronome, and lets you set it down a few semi-tones if that's what floats your boat and, as they say on TV, ""All for an incredibly low price!""I keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag, just in case.  At this price, I already have a half dozen Super Tights with two more on the way."
1,5,I have the Snark 2 but read that this was the best so far.  I got and agreethis works better.  I would recommend it to anyone.
1,5,"I replaced an older Snark that I use all the time, but seems to be cutting out sometimes.  I love this new one.  It's a bit easier to see the display."
1,5,"I have used one of the black box meter style tuners for years and struggled with it. I could never quite get the fine tune I was looking for, and I have a little bit if a pitch issue trying to tune by ear. These little tuners are amazing. So easy to use, and portable, and cheap. I have several now, one for every guitar. Cheap is important, because they are made of plastic and I have had one break at the joint after a lot of use. I also received one without a battery, which upset me at the time. I am in Afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by. If you figure they cost about as much as a fancy coffee drink they provide a lot of tuning goodness for a little money."
1,4,"my only complaint is that it doesn't seem as accurate as some traditional tuners, but that's probably by design so you aren't fiddling over fractions of a semitone when you're trying to tune your guitar between songs/sets"
1,5,I like the SN-2. Just thought I'd try the SN-8 Super tight tuner and was not at all disappointed.  Snark tuners have always performed well for me.  I play guitar and ukulele.  I've used and own many tuners and brands.  The Snarks just work great and the price is hard to beat.  I usually buy several at a time and give them as gifts to my musician friends.  For anyone who plays acoustic guitar - these things are so handy.
1,4,"When the unit first arrived, I was concerned because the box had been damaged.  It shipped in an envelop.  However, once I opened it, I discovered an undamaged Snark tuner inside.  In an odd way, this reassured me further, as it obviously took a beating and remained undamaged.  When I put in the battery and turned it on, it functioned properly.  It clips to my guitar strong and stays put.  It's easy to read, even when I'm on stage and the lighting is less than appropriate for reading a display this size from arm's length.  I'm very pleased with the unit."
1,5,works very smoothly and doesn't eat batteries like the foot pedal types of tuners. We have a local place that sells the batteries for this in a 5 pack for $1.00 (yep a buck). I'm sold on these and will be getting another as soon as I need one
1,5,"I just got my Snark tuner, and I'm very impressed with it. It attaches easily to the headstock of my guitar. The digital readout is easy to see, and it gets me in perfect tune quickly. It is far superior to previous tuners I've used."
1,5,"I have several Snarks. They are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with. Fast and accurate. The SN-8 IS a little faster and slightly more accurate than the other, older models, with a brighter display (at slightly reduced battery life) but they are all great. I have lots of tuners, and several brands of clip ons. This is my favorite. There is no close second. I play 5 string bass in a band and at church as well as guitar. I love this tuner."
1,5,I got one of these and now a week later I have 3 what a great learning tool. simple and sweet
1,5,"These snark tuners are really cool.This SN-8 model comes this a metronome, and also you can scale up/down with buttons for when using a capo.highly recommended."
0,3,It does a fair job but I have to place it all over the headstock to find a spot it will settle down on. It seems to pick up sympathetic string notes. I actually liked the lesser blue colored one specifically for guitars it was always responsive and accurate.
1,5,"I really think it doesn't matter which Snark you buy, they are all set up to measure tuning within any instrument's range.  It was cheap, and affordable.  One of the issues I've had with Snarks is that if you get the one with the vibe and the mic, the mic quits working, and you really only need the vibe anyway, so why pay more?"
1,5,"Originally I bought another Snark, and liked it well enough. I'd seen this one on YouTube, and thought its little bobble head looked ... kinda silly. But then a friend lent me his for a couple of days, and I really liked the experience of being able to glance over and see if I was in tune. I was hooked. I'll look silly if it lets me stay in tune.The built-in metronome doesn't have a lot of volume, but it's clearly visible.You also get a little baggie containing three picks, the carry bag for the tuner, and a battery. Warranty runs for a year. Altogether, I'm very satisfied with this tuner."
1,5,It seems redundant to review again except to point out I have bought more and will buy more. I will have one for every instrument stored with and actually on each guitar inside it's case. I have given out 5 and kept 4 - I have 11 working guitars - I need 7 more Snarks.....  some have had their batteries run down in under a year - but I get close to 2 years off a new battery - ( Batteries are a bit costly)
1,5,"I've used a variety of tuners.  When the Snark first came out the price was so low I thought it must not be that good.  However, I borrowed one one time and ended up buying several.  What I like is that it has a very good display which is very easy to read (the colors help a lot as well as the layout of the display) , is seems to be very accurate, the clamp does a good job of staying on the neck and it seems durable enough.  I have had issues with one or more of these criteria with other tuners.  About the only thing that has been an issue, is that on occation, it won't register. Turning it on and off or just trying a different string usually solves the problem.  Also it may be a litle larger than some like."
1,5,This is my second and I love them so much. They work flawlessley and tune is amazing! Get one and dont hesitate
1,4,"This is a nifty little tuner. It's accurate and is fast to turn yellow if you're off by even the slightest degree. I just leave it on my telecaster. It's a little deeper than I thought it would be; it actually lifted the tele up a little when placed in the case. But after a few weeks, the foam conformed and the neck now rests on the case support. The ratchet is a little gimmicky, but once it's set, it can be easy slid off and on the headstock.This little tuner is made to be left on one guitar. If you want one that you can move from instrument to instrument, then get a Snark."
1,5,"I've used this tuner for both my acoustic guitar and banjo for a year now and like them a lot.  We got this one for my wife's mandolin.  It's small, barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back.  I understand it can be a tight fit on some headstocks, it's snug on my 12 fret slot-head guitar due to the buttons pointing straight down but it works ok for me.  The accuracy is as good or better than any I've used.Pros:AccurateCheapEasy to see in daylight or darkGood battery lifeIt's always there, you don't have to hunt for a tuner.Cons:I wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me!"
1,5,"I had one of these and lost it, replaced it with the NS Planet Waves micro clip on tuner, which is not as good. This tuner has a better, higher contrast display which is needed for bright outdoor gigs. It works more predictably and tunes smoother than the micro too. Easily worth the extra dollar. It's a little taller than the micro, but still very small and if it's behind a headstock it doesn't make a difference visually, the main difference is the height if the tuner, width and depth are about the same. That also means a bigger readout. So not really a con. I use it on a godin with a slotted headstock, positioned so I can see it between the tuning keys. Easy to use, bummed I lost it and replaced it with an inferior tuner, I'll be getting another one of these soon... Should probably pick up one for every guitar and be done with it."
1,5,"I've been a musician for over 40 years.  I've seen an awful lot of products come and go.  I don't get excited about the latest-and-greatest very easily... but having said that, this is the best idea in headstock tuners I have encountered. I bought one, and found it so useful, I ordered two more!  Planet Waves makes good quality stuff, and they make some 'faddish' stuff.  This item is definitely in the good quality family.  It's easy to read outdoors in the daylight, yet not so bright as to distract in low stage light.  Great design, Planet Waves!  Excellent price, GO-DPS!"
1,4,"Not bad, but I had intended on leaving this on my instrument. I bought a few for different basses and guitars. But the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag (no problem with hard cases) leaving the battery dead when I took the instrument out of the case. The switch SHOULD be on the side of the unit. FWIW, I like my Snarks better...faster and more stable tuning. A near miss with the NS."
1,5,"This little thing is just what I needed for my acoustics. My amp has a tuner but my regular acoustics had no true way of being tuned until now. I have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up. The read-out is easy to see since it gives you color guides to tune by. Red is wayyy off, yellow when you start getting close and green when you are in tune. Great for a quick look in between songs. Highly recommended."
1,5,"When I first installed these strings I wasn't too impressed.  They felt different under my fingers and the sound was much more tinny than I'm used to.  However, after a month and a half of playing, I really do love these strings.  I got used to the feel, the tinny sound mellowed out a little, and man do they stay in tune!Cobalt strings aren't as warm as traditional nickle strings but if you play hard rock or metal I find the gain to be more articulate.  Solo's pierce through the mix without becoming too shrill and muted playing has better voicing, in my opinion.  They're also super fast.  I mentioned earlier that they feel different, and they do.  It's not necessarily a bad different it's just slicker and not as coiled feeling.  Hard to describe, but if you're used to playing nickle you'll notice the difference.Honestly, my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune.  I went on vacation for a week, came back, picked up the guitar, expecting to have to tune it, and every single note was dead on.  As they age, you'll have to make a few minor tuning tweaks but its nowhere near as frequent as nickle.These really are a good set of strings.  If you try them just make sure to give them time.  They get better with wear."
0,3,"Okay... just strung these up and ran them through three different amps and about 25 different pedals (metal, overdrive, echo, reverb, fuzz, etc).  So keep in mind that they haven't broken in yet as I do this review.  But I do feel confident in what I report here.They are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels.  On the high gain metal muff, fullbore, guytone metal monster, swollen pickle, and big muff they sound really nice.... a lot of harmonics and output captured. For that 5 stars easy.  I don't think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold.  Other's may feel differently I am sure.  Then again, Ernie Ball even states they are very bight high output.  So you are getting what they say.However, for a warm bluesy tone I couldn't get anywhere close to my sound like I can with the pure nickels.  For that 1.5 star.  Average to 3 I guess... :).  Forget about the nickel wound steel all together (those are really lame).  Either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment.  For shredding go cobalt... for warm/woman tone go PURE nickels (that's PURE folks!!).  I also really like the d'addario pures.Also, these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel.  Hope this helps."
1,4,I recently changed them out for a different type of EB's while they were good the were not exactly what I was looking for. not sure the new set is either but time will tell.
1,4,"The cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling. Maybe it's just me, but that's how they come across. I noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel, but don't lose that new sound new as fast. I didn't have near as much string stretch with these either. I'll keep using them, just maybe in a different gauge."
1,5,"Not only do they seem to last a little longer with less wear but they sound good with my cheap no-name Japanese knock-off. I play mostly hard-rock these days with some mild distortion but on occasion crank it up for some tech-metal and prog-rock for solo projects where I'm playing pretty fast and sometimes hard. They also handle de-tuning well and even when using pretty loose open tuning like DADAAD, they are clear with good sustain."
1,5,"These strings are amazing - they have increased power, tone and flexibility that other strings just do not have. They sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups. The tone is seperated throughout the string gauges so that each sting has its own distinctive part of the tone. I cna't say enough about them but get some for yourself - I'd be surprised if you ever went back to regualr strings."
1,5,Works very well although I wish it had wider strapping or a choice of purchasing with a wider strap. Don't hesitate to purchase.
1,4,I didn't like the arm through one part and your head through the other so I cut it apart and just hang my uke from my neck and the top of the sound hole. Works like a charm......is more easily adjusted and the felt lined sound hole clip has not damaged my uke at all.
1,4,"Ukulele straps are a rare thing and I've yet to find the perfect one.  This one gets close.  Not all uke players use straps, some do and some don't.  Purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced.  However I have two acoustic-electric ukes and they are heavier than the non-electrified ones the purists use.  I've found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing.  A preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar.  This Neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument less.There is another device called a Uke Leash that also works well.  It ties onto the headstock. I like this Neotech better because even though the instrument isn't balanced perfectly, it is balanced better than with the Uke Leash.  The Uke Leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the Neotech Simple Sling.This Neotech Simple Sling soundhole clip strap works on my Concert and Tenor ukes equally well, but I have to adjust it some when switching it between the two.The wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument.  I don't know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached.  This strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments.You have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument.  The clip on the Neotech Sling is wider than most I've seen and this extra width reduces, but does not completely eliminate, that risk. The wider clip spreads the stress out.  I've seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and I'm afraid to try them on a ukulele.  I like this one with the wide clip and will keep it.The Uke Leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place, so I like this Neotech soundhole clip device better.The only thing I don't like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap.  But once on it is great!  You look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you can't do it with a hat on.  It gets easier the more you do it.I'd buy the Neotech Simple Sling again.  I recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but don't want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes.  Just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on."
1,5,"I bought a classical guitar and then realized that I needed on of the around the neck with a sound hole hook type straps.  Bought one and due to past neck surgery, found that strap painful to wear after a few minutes.  Later saw this one and decided to try it.  Works perfect, really adjustable, and no pressure on my neck (since it doesn't go around your neck).  Great design!"
1,5,"but works well,  I have a different brand which has a string and small hook but I find when adjusted correctly I cannot remove it,,  this sling keeps the head loop large so you can get it off without a binch of hassle,, I find the hook to be wide though and could be alot better with a thinner hook."
1,5,"Very nice classical guitar strap. I have used this style of strap for over forty years with traditional style classicals that do not have strap buttons.  Don't expect it to work like a strap on a standard acoustic or electric guitar. This is designed to only hold the guitar in position while you are playing it. It will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it. This is the way this type of strap is made to work, and is certainly not a design flaw as some reviewers have suggested. Holds my Cordoba in position perfectly."
0,3,"I wan't sure I would like this thing when I ordered it, but it was cheap enough to try.  I don't like using it as much as I thought I would, but that's just me.  The device works as advertised.  Over a long period of use, I think it might leave a mark on the sound hole, even though the hook is padded."
1,5,"These do definitely have more output. I really don't know what else to say about them. It's all about personal preference so... But if you like earnie ball non cobalt you will probably like these too. Oh, one thing I can say is that harmonic squeals and harmonics in general are better defined and sustain longer with these."
1,5,"If you bought Rocksmith 2014, and use an electric guitar, get this.  The cobalt strings are picked up very well by the magnetic pickups, and in turn Rocksmith detects the strings A LOT better. I had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up.  After getting these the game picks them all up now."
0,3,"Tried these on Les Paul style with Jimmy pgae wiring harness and through four different amps and about 25 different pedals (metal, overdrive, echo, reverb, fuzz, etc). So keep in mind that they haven't broken in yet as I do this review. But I do feel confident in what I report here.They are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels. On the high gain metal muff, fullbore, guytone metal monster, swollen pickle, and big muff they sound really nice.... a lot of harmonics and output captured. For that 5 stars easy. I don't think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold. Other's may feel differently I am sure. Then again, Ernie Ball even states they are very bight high output. So you are getting what they say.However, for a warm bluesy tone I couldn't get anywhere close to my sound like I can with the pure nickels. For that 1.5 star. Average to 3 I guess... :). Forget about the nickel wound steel all together (those are really lame). Either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment. For shredding go cobalt... for warm/woman tone go PURE nickels (that's PURE folks!!). I also really like the d'addario pures.Also, these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel. Hope this helps."
1,5,Great feel to them and nice sounding.  They do seem to stay in tune a bit longer but then they are thicker than what I normally use.  I think I will try these in the super slinky
1,5,"These strings have a snappier feel and a louder volume (amplified) than regular nickel / steel strings. Cobalt is a different material for making strings and is supposed to have a higher output and a longer life. I recently ordered the new M-Steels from Ernie Ball to try them out as they are supposed to have even more Cobalt for even better output. I use P90 single coils on my Godin LG and these strings sound great. They have a nice feel to them and I can bend the heck out of them. No breaking. No problems with slipping and tuning. I'm hoping the M-Steels will be even better, but if not, these are a vast improvement over the regular strings that I was using, which were Ernie Ball's regular slinky's, made from Nickel."
1,4,"These strings are really nice.  They have a great tone, decent longevity, and the trademark Ernie Ball feel.  Some reviewers have stated that the strings have a silky feel - even comparing them to coated strings - but I don't find that to be the case.  They feel pretty much like any other guitar string, albeit much gentler than stainless strings.  If money were no option, I'd probably move to these exclusively, but at roughly three times the price of good to great nickel strings, I'm not sure that they are good enough to justify the massive price premium.  Each string did come inside its own protective sleeve, which made restringing easier and is a feature that I absolutely expect from a premium string."
0,2,"Installed these on my Schecter C-1 Hellraiser. I had very high hopes for these, but as with any new over-hyped technology, they failed to impress me. The only good thing I have to say is the tone is good. But realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings. You would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison. So now that I have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse. They are not silky smooth feeling as advertised. If anything they feel worse than regular strings. Last but not least: they are bad for frets. Just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick. I don't know about anyone else but I don't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.For the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear."
0,3,Not great but not bad as well.  The base strings feel really strange when sliding. The 6th string and the 1st string were cut while I was playing so I had to change them the second day I installed them.  Bending feels easy.
1,5,"The best EB Slinky's I've ever used. On these I use the light's--9's. Even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well. I use them on all 4 of My Guitar's. Two Fender American Standard's, Gibson ES-335. Gibson Les Paul/ with Bigsby. I always have a set in each case..... Try'um... Ya won't regret it !!!!!"
1,5,"These lighter strings are still the best thing for guitar tone since they ran a wire to them. My other review was for the heavier gauge Cobalts but these sound just as good, regardless of P90, strat single coil or humbucker. Great tone, sustain and flexibility. I am sold on any Cobalt gauge - head and shoulders better than any other string on the market and I have tried them all."
1,5,"I love these strings. I get a much higher output , much better response and much better sound. Great strings for just a little more."
1,5,"I've tried other strings with the Jackson with no luck ( what a stupid guitar to string ) anyway I like the sound they do seem to carry better, if only a little. The texture seems to be a bit rougher but I'm sure they will be fine to play once broken in. Pulse there Rocksmith endorsed LOL."
1,5,"I bought this harmonica for our son...the music enthusiast. He loves it. It seems to be manufactured well...as it is substantive in weight  and seems to be solidly built. Only time will tell. But for now it seems to be a decent harmonica. I actually bought two harmonicas for him, just in case one breaks. Couldn't pass it up as it was selling for such an affordable price. Our son says it's easy to use and has a good sound quality.  Hey, if it makes our son happy, so be it. Highly recommend."
1,5,I bought this harmonica to go with my guitar and add a little extra music. This was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well.
1,5,It was suggested that I start with this product since I'm learning and adding it to my repertoire of instruments.  Comes in a nice box and the quality is outstanding.
0,1,"kripes man..the one time I go and actually buy a ""honer"" and its a ""bummer"" this thing has 3 keys off tune!! I can buy stuff 10 times better quality from Chinaand never have this kinda junk. Maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and I 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan Ive never got a harp this trashy B4!...... all i can say is buy Merana's for tryin out buy ""suzuki"" or Swan"" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off. Oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a ""Mississipi River Harp"" for only  $5.oo if you have a ""Burke's"" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the Doctah has spoken! :)"
1,5,Good little instrument to pass the time with while setting on a porch or at a campfire with friends. Buy this.
1,5,"I'm a beginner harmonica player, and this was perfect for me! I am able to practice with it easily, and it didn't cost me a fortune as some of the more professional harmonicas are."
1,4,"I suppose it does what it is suppose to do, it is not expensive and a good way to get a feel if I want to spend more bucks for a better one."
1,5,"This harmonica is great for beginners, or professionals. I know a couple professional players who prefer this nifty harmonica over the more expensive ones. Highly recommended. Plays, sounds, feels and looks great. Also comes with a little note sheet"
1,5,"Excellent for a serious youngster learning to play, priced right.  The thirteen-year-old for whom it was purchased likes it very much and is progressing very well."
1,5,I love this light both for the music stand and for my laptop. It has two brightness settings. Illuminates an entire music stand if adjusted properly.
1,5,"We got this for my young son who enjoys reading in his bed prior to going to sleep at night. He really likes this light and it is bright enough for him to read by, but not too bright that it hurts his eyes. A good buy. I could see where this could be useful in other applications, like on a music stand, but it also makes a great reading lamp attached to a bed."
0,3,"I found the brightness of the light to be adequate, and would probably give it 4 or 5 stars, but it takes three AAA batteries that according to the packaging are only good for 7 hours. I did not realize this when I bought it, but after replacing the batteries a few times I went to a local music store and asked for a light that you could plug in to the AC.  They sold me the Encore model for $35, it is brighter, includes the AC adaptor and a nice carrying case  After I got home I figured out that they sell an optional AC adaptor for the hammerhead for about $10, so for only $5 I could have just bought the Encore model and been better off.  If you are going to get one of these hammerhead lights, go ahead and spring for one that includes the adaptor, it will save you a lot of money in the long run."
0,2,"Not really bright enough. Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same.  I would look for something else if I didn't already have this.  OK for reading a small book in bed, but doesn't cover the sheet music brightly enough."
1,5,This little dude does a great job. The clip works great on my music stand and the light itself has a bright display and a dimmer display to save batteries. I highly recommend. I can sit in a completely dark room and see the music fine!
0,3,"Cool little light, but three minor gripes: (1) the arm is of a very flexible metal coil and almost a little too flexible, (2) the battery compartment cover comes off a little easy, and (3) the light is a little on the dim side. But I think it'll work well overall and I like the fact that it's so compact and portable."
1,5,"If you've read my review of the much cheaper Hohner Old Standby Harmonica, Key of C you know that I love the Special 20. It's great for beginners or experts alike. Sounds great right out of the box and plays well. I was able to bend notes right away with this one, while other cheaper harps take a long time (or never) to break in properly. All the notes/reeds sounded good. If you're serious about playing, you will be very happy to have this harmonica around. I've had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite."
1,5,This is the first harmonica I ever used. I did some research and ended up with the special 20 in the key of C. I have no basis for comparison and I am a beginner but this instrument sounds awesome! The construction is perfect and the included case is very appreciated : ) For $25 I can't complain!
1,5,"tennessee saxe/fun to use... not going to be part of a blues band anytime soon.. Still, seems to be good quality..Of course Hohner has been around longer than me...."
1,5,Easy to play. Decent quality. Not expensive. Easy to bend. Plastic comb with no recess.This is the lowest level you'd want to really play the harmonica and it won't break the bank.
1,4,"I am a ""newbie"" to the world of playing the blues harp; however, I am not a beginner to music. I have played guitar fervently for the past 22 years, so I knew a little something when I thought I would try to learn the harmonica. Technique is of utmost importance and I found learning how to pucker and tongue block on this instrument was effortless. It sounds, for the most part, in tune and its tone is great. My kids love to hear me play it! However, there is 1 ""con"" to this wonderful instrument. After owning it for several days, the DRAW 2 hole went flat. I researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit... so I worked on my technique some more. To my dismay, the one note on the harmonica that allows you to bend into 2 other tones, and is considered the ""sweet spot"" of the instrument, did not work right. Obviously you cannot take it back to the seller - it's not really his/her fault. I am not sure how to repair it, but I feel that I should have to do so this early in the game. Maybe it's my naivete' in hoping for a perfect instrument. So, I took one star away because of this problematic issue. Otherwise, I really like this harmonica."
1,5,"Sounds great! Still suck at bending 3 &4. A buddy of mine got one, and he's killing it on the bends. we both been playing for about 3 months. Great harp. Will buy another if it ever wears out."
1,5,"I bought the Special 20 Pro Pack(Keys G,A & C)!!Love them. Was using cheep Pidmont Blues Harps(toys)!!I had to have more, like an addiction!!I bought a D then this Bb, then E.Won't be long & I'll get a F!!This harp,Bb, has a beautiful tone.Always loved the sound of the Bb!!Made in Germany,quality musical instrument,not a toy!!If you own Special 20's then you already know how good they are.If you don't try one.You might end up with 6 like me,or more,in no time!!Worth every cent!!If they are good enough for John Popper & Bob Dylan they're good enough for me.A PLEASURE to play!!!Joe"
1,5,Really great sounding harmonica. Beautiful sound and very well made! Very happy with this product and the price is incredible!
1,5,First real harmonica i have owned. Read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many. The price is right and the quality seems good too. Didnt take me long to start to pick up some techniques such as bending and single/double blow/draw. Still trying to get the overblow. I am far from perfecting the techniques but this harp is pretty easy to bend notes on. It has a good seal also. Only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back.
1,5,"I am forever meeting people who rave about this harp, but had not tried one for myself until today. It is a wonderful harp, with perfect tuning, easy bend-ability, does not buzz or squeak, and belies it's reasonable sale price.  I went for the Key of Bb, and love the tone, the playability and the just right feel of the instrument. For anyone not yet having a Special 20, I heartily recommend it - beginner, intermediate or advanced students, or the performer on stage - this harp is simply great. I am not often surprised by anything but this harp surprised me - it is not expensive at all, and sounds as good as others I have that are four times the price. I am a Hohner Marine Band Special Twenty convert  - I will get a couple more to add to my ever growing box of harps."
1,5,"I've been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010.  Good news:  these Aquila strings are on most new ukuleles.  Bad news:  These Aquila strings are NOT standard on some others.  I was able to take off the old ones and install these in less than half-hour.  (You can get a tutorial to do anything on YouTube!)  They will stretch and de-tune for a few days, but once tuned, they sound, and just perform, great.  Good price, great product.  Order extra to keep on hand."
1,5,"You can't go wrong with aquila. Amazing song, very warm strong tone also carries a nice volume too.Long lasting, made with quality. Improves the sound greatly on less expensive ukes in other wordsit can make a 50 dollar uke sound like a 100 dollar uke!"
1,5,"Got a new tenor uke and couldn't resist putting my fav strings on it.  Replaced GHS strings.  So far, so good."
1,5,"need to learn to read, since I have bought two other sets with a wound C string,, so bought these because I was having alot of trouble with my tenor uku my wife bought for me for Xmas,,  have since made a new nut and saddle to fix ( ok bandaid ) a high third fret which also I have sanded down and now is lining up with the others.."
1,5,"These strings are great.  They are very mellow sounding and I like them a lot.  This is what came on my uke, and I wanted to make sure I hade replacements.  I got both hi and lo G sets."
1,5,"I put these on an Epiphone Les Paul acoustic-electric and it sounds so great. They are very smooth and warm and magical, like a mythical unicorn."
1,5,"Great strings, the strings on my Epiphone Les Paul wore out so i bought these, my ukulele sounds better than when i first bought it. Kinda wish they came in black, the white contrasts with the color of my uke."
1,5,Best strings for my ukulele. These are great quality. I only use Aquila strings on my instruments. Highly recommended. My ukulele has a better tone with these strings.
1,5,"If you buy a ukulele, and it does not have these strings, you should replace them with these strings. Strings make a big difference in any ukulele."
1,4,However I have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching.  Usually I do. My bad.
1,5,These strings are the best.  Haven't found any others that sound and feel so good.  They lasted 3 years and I play nearly every day for hours.  Go figure!  I actually thought I didn't need to change strings (still don't know for sure) because they still sounded so good and show no wear.  Anyway I decided to change the strings because it's been so long.  Happy that I did however.
1,5,"I have three uku, soprano, concert ( Love the best ) and a tenor,,  this brand of strings rocks.  enjoy"
1,5,"Aquila strings will never let you down. Highly recommended by all serious Ukulele players. Italian made, need I say more."
1,5,"I admit it, my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick. Hold my tab securely so I can flip though it with ease while I'm still playing my guitar. Much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage."
1,4,"I had so much trouble putting this thing together and figuring out exactly how it worked that I almost sent it back.But with a little trial and error, I figured it out.That said, this thing is ROCK SOLID... I was a bit apprehensive at the idea of suspending a $700 iPad five feet off the ground in a spring loaded plastic clip, but this thing is built like a brick house and is super strong in terms of grip."
1,5,Easy to adjust and holds the iPad secure.  I actually have 2 iPads on one mic stand (one shows charts while the other plays backing tracks).  No issues at all and would order again.
1,5,"I'm the lead singer in a band and I use an app on my Kindle Fire as a teleprompter, This mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face. The mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the Kindle fire and mount suffered no damage. The mount is easy to remove as well"
1,5,"I use this clamped to a table and it's a superb product. I have a 7&#34; tablet, and a 9.7&#34; Touchpad, and they both work very well in it. Nice mount. Great value. Buy it."
1,4,"I like the overall design of this mount although it would be nice to have a little bit more articulation. The best thing is that I can leave my ipad in the LIFEPROOF case for performances so I don't have to worry about water, sweat, or other various liquids and beverages hurting my main daime, my ipad. I use my ipad for almost everything these days and I certainly can't see going back to a lyric book after using the ipad and the SET LIST MAKER app. Then thes the real book app and of course notes and pages, iBooks, etc. it is a great tool for gigging musicians and this mount gets it up where you can see it. Best thing I've bought for my ipad in a while."
1,5,I've been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as I play on a weekly basis and it has been great! Being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient. It grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily. I've owned it for a while now and haven't had any problems with it.
1,5,"I used it once, will only use it when I'm in front of it, so that, no one takes it, it works great when you're using your tablet and I use it for playing Pandora when playing in clubs, It not Djing it's DJ sound without the DJ, no offends DJ your job isn't easy, but when their isn't a DJ this helps. Remember to have Wifi in order to connect to Panadora."
0,2,"I bought this brand because I have one of their mic stand mounts (for iPhone) which I like a lot.Pros:The clips did a good job holding my iPad Mini without having to remove the folio type cover (Marware Axis).Quality seems acceptable for the price, the ball swivel works well.Cons:It's too heavy for my mic stands.  I tried it on the boom arm and it made it top-heavy and unstable.  If the boom is positioned in a very upright position it's ok, but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose!The clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome.I had high hopes for this one but it's not going to work for me.  I have returned it and ordered a different ChargerCity model, the one with the lever-type mount."
1,5,"I was a little nervous about putting my iPad on the stand, but this is a substantial and well thought out design. It comes with clips that can be used for other tablets. It's very nicely adjustable and I feel very confident that my iPad is safe and secure on the stand."
1,5,This is a must have for musicians or even speech givers that may want to use a table for their music/speeches.  It is easily mounted on the Mic stand and can be adjusted to your needs. I would not do without it now as it easily replaced my cumbersome music sheet stand. I am using it with my Samsung tablet and can also be used with my wife's Toshiba tablet.  Highly recommended.
1,4,It does the job. It's bulky but it works well. It comes with an extra set of holders for thicker tablets (or to use the tablet while still in the case).
0,1,"This product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside.  Upon receiving mine and assembling it, it broke immediately while I was trying to mount an iPad onto it.  It also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability.  The metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle."
0,2,"First time using item and it broke. The round back that screws onto the mic stand broke. I was really excited to have this and us it now that I transferred all my music sheet to my iPad. As soon as I took it off the mic stand the round piece came off. Would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review, but it only kept referring to delivery. I do like the product and it did hold my iPad steady even with a leather case on. Sad!"
1,5,I switched over to using an Android tablet for notation when playing music. All of my 7&#34; tablets fit and even my larger HP Touchpad fits. I ended up using an Ainol Fire as my regular tablet. It would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand.
1,4,"This tablet mount allows me to use my large Toshiba Thrive in live performance situations now.  It makes a solid physical connection to the mic stand, I never worry about it readjusted or slipping during use."
1,4,Love joyo pedals.  Not sure yet on the new line.  They just dont feel as solid to me. That being said the pedal sounds great. great distortion no issues beyond my concerns regarding the light build and esp the switch. time will tell
1,5,"I am a confessed and unrepentant hoarder of dirtboxes and I like this pedal a lot.  This is my 5th Joyo pedal- I already own the Ultimate Drive, Vintage Overdrive, Crunch Distortion, and Octive Fuzz pedals.  I consider Joyo and the Dano Cool Cat line to be some of the best values in stomp-boxes these days.  You've already heard the particulars about this pedal, so I won't go into the features.  The build quality does appear to be a hair shoddier than all my other Joyo pedals (which are earlier versions).  The switch seems a little less heavy-duty, and the case seems to be thinner metal.  That said, the case is still metal and isn't going to fail in any way.  The switch- well, we will have to wait and see.  For $35 or so, I'm not going to complain.  Soundwise, this product offers excellent gain for this price level.  It's not particularly suited for Pantera, but you can do modern mid-gain up to Metallica without any problems.  This is not an overdrive, so it doesn't do the 'just on the verge of breakup' thing like a tubescreamer does.  That's not what it was designed to do.  I run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good.  I've also boosted it with the following with a good result:  SD Pickup Booster, Cool Cat Transparent Overdrive, Tubescreamer (TS9,Joyo Vintage OD, Behringer TO800), Tech 21 Comptortion.  If you play rock/ hard rock through a single channel amp (like a Blues Jr, Valve Jr or Pro Jr) and you want to make it a two channel amp, this will get you there. Most people compare this pedal to the Suhr Riot.  I do not own that pedal, so I can not fairly make a comparison.  I have seen several videos comparing the two and as far as that is concerned, I hear enough similarity that I am not compelled to shell out $200 for the Riot. Another comparison that gets made is that the US Dream is close to a ProCo RAT.  I own an original 80s RAT and I don't think they are all that similar.  The US Dream has a tighter low end and more treble.  Not better or worse- just different enough that they don't completely cover the same sonic territory.  Admitedly, I don't own a newer RAT-  maybe that one is closer to the US Dream.  For what they are charging, this is another home run for Joyo-"
1,5,"This Joyo JF-34 US dream distortion box is very well made and produces a good range of distortion effect. My son has taken up playing guitar about a year or so ago and now that he is past the basics he was interested in trying different techniques. This box can be set to make minimal distortion or maxed out to produce very heavily distorted effects.The box is very good quality, with nice large controls and metal foot switch. The unit can be powered with a 9v battery or via an external power source (not included).This is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players.Highly Recommended!CFHNote: Manufacturer provided unit for review but that in no way influences my rating or comments."
1,5,"Reading the product description may give you an idea about this product. I received, plugged it in and was impressed with the clean yet great sounding distortion. It's solid, well made and looks/feels like it can handle the world tour.Get it!"
1,5,True meaning of the US Dream...it is hard with a soft overtone giving a sense of calm and well being... wow yes that is it. no more to be written joy o the american dream.
1,5,"this pedal is simple...i own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals ,.i love them all...they all differ somewhat,,,,i fell in love with this one the most,.,set volume and gain to maximum loudness that you desire,,,then back off your guitar volume and it cleans up wonderfully....and when you are ready to wail, just turn up your guitar volume.,,,,and whammo,...its a very non-colored sounding overdrive...,,its hard to call it any particualr sound...its just really good and clear and powerful...."
1,4,"I realized I didn't have any distortion pedals, only a bunch of overdrive pedals, so I set out to find a distortion pedal.  After scouring the forums I find out the pedals that are supposed to be very good are also very pricey.  Since I don't want to spend a bunch of money I get this one and it is great, albeit quite bright.  The only thing I don't like about this pedal is the brightness, which can be tamed with the tone knob, otherwise it is easy to use, sounds really good and is transparent. Transparent in that it doesn't add a lot of color to your amp just distortion.  I use this pedal with vintage Fender Silverface amps, which are already bright, so I turn the tone more to the bass side and also shape my tone with the Spark Booster that I have in front of the US Dream. I have to use the Spark Booster to hit the US Dream hard because most of the guitars I use don't have hot enough pickups.The price was right, I'm happy with it."
0,1,"This review is on the seller Yorozuya Yokoshima ,not the product. These people posted what seemed like a good price (not ridiculously low) on the Us Dream pedal. It was to be shipped from Japan. They then decided the price was an error and canelled my order. This kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on Amazon.com because the item was less than $4.00 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers Yorozuya Yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item. I am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior. I lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident."
1,4,"Reputedly the Joyo Us Dream is a copy of the Suhr Riot distortion pedal. After watching a side by side comparison on Youtube, I decided to buy one.I would describe the Us Dream as sounding like a bright Proco Rat with a little less sustain and a much tighter low end. It has an MXR style enclosure (that means you have to remove the back plate to change batteries) and a surprisingly narrow sweet spot. But for $48 dollars I'm  happy with purchase."
1,5,"Dirt box gold for under 50 bucks! Highly adjustable tone, volume and distortion level that won't tank your amplifier tone, while letting you get between everything from back alley blues to blistering metal. I love this pedal!!! The true bypass is a bonus if you are in love with your amp's tone, but lose it when you engage your pedal. Not anymore. I know there are some great distortion pedals on the market, but you won't find this quality and tone at a better price. Joyo win.Sorry OS-2 - it's pawnshop time for you!"
1,5,"The US Dream is supposed ""clone"" of the Suhr Riot, and is the only one of the ""new"" model Joyo pedals that I own.  This is a high-gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a ProCo Rat, but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings.When I first pulled it out of the box and plugged in, it sounded great, but I wondered if it might be a little bright.  I was pleasantly surprised when I rolled back the tone knob to around 10 o'clock, and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness.  At least with my setup (Les Paul into a Vox Valvetronix 40-watt), this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full-sounding power chords and singing high leads.  Unlike some distortion pedals that have a ""fizzy"" (DS-1) or ""cocked wah"" sound (Boss Power Stack), I was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar.While Joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices, this is one of the first three I would recommend, along with the outstanding Ultimate Drive and the warm-sounding Vintage Overdrive.However, it's worth noting that the build quality is a bit suspect on the ""new"" model Joyo pedals, which are notably lighter than those numbered JF-17 and lower.  The weight is comparable to an MXR '78 Badass Distortion, except the switch and output jacks are more suspect.  Still, if a pedal SOUNDS great and has yet to fail on me, I refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me.  I think if you take care of it and use it reasonably, it should last for awhile, but if it doesn't, being out $55 is still better than being out $100+."
0,2,"A very boring, dull, uninspiring Pedal. Don't waste your time with this. A Boss SD-1 or Digitech Bad Monkey are far better options for this price range."
1,5,"I just received this a day ago and bought it on whim after being very impressed with the Joyo Crunch Pedal.  This is (I think) based on a very expensive sweet honey drive pedal.  It's supposed to be very reactive to your playing.  Dig in and it puts out distortion, play soft and it cleans up.  This is much more noticeable the cleaner you run your amp.  I can say it's pretty reactive and feels like a very responsive tube screamer.  I've heard some say they find the distortion from this pedal a little harsh but I find is wonderfully smooth with some grit.  I found it really warmed up my sound in a good way.  I'm playing an american strat with noisless Dimarzio Area pickups through a Vox AC15 and it's an awesome combo.  I put this pedal in front of my OCD and I was really getting some sweet tones.  If I had to play out with just my amp and one pedal for a little dirt this might win over my OCD.  It's expensive for a Joyo but cheap for a really good OD stomp.  It's definitely not for metal or heavier distortion stuff but it's got plenty on tap for blues and classic rock.  So far I've been super pleased by Joyo pedals.  The jury is still out on how well they hold but but they sure sound and perform pretty darn well."
1,4,"this is a solid overdrive but not really very different than a bunch of other joyo overdrive pedals out there.  I have a bunch of these pedals and they are starting to blend together.  Definitely would not consider this a low gain overdrive as advertised.  Lots more gain on tap than a low gain pedalLike many other reviewers, my gripe with the new pedals is the switch. may hold up but these new pedals seem so much less solid than the prior generation"
1,5,"This is my 6th Joyo pedal and like the others, it does not dissapoint.  I think these and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the best bang for your buck in pedals these days.  Like many have mentioned, this pedal is like a TS but without the mid-hump.  This pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture.  When you run it into a cleanish tube amp and you dig it, it breaks up.  When you play lightly, it gets cleaner- which is why it is so similar to the $200 Sweet Honey pedal (the controls are also identical but I haven't compared the internals).  That touch sensitivity is lost IMHO if you stack this with another dirt box or if you are running it into an amp that is already raging with gain.  When you do that, it acts more like a traditional OD would- which is totally cool, but you are losing the touch sensitivity thing that sets this pedal apart.  If I could only bring one dirt box to the gig it would probably be something more mid-gain (like the Joyo Ultimate Drive or the Dano Transparent OD)  but if you are in the market for a sweet honey pedal and don't have that kind of bankroll, you should definately check this out-Edit:  Having owned this pedal for a while, I realize I was incorrect in saying you lose touch sensitivity running into another dirtbox.  This pedal actually plays well with mid-gain types of overdrives like the Joyo Ultimate Drive, the OCD, or the Dano Drive.  When you dig in, you CAN get more breakup so long as the other overdrive isn't dimed.  This pedal has become an essential, 'always on' pedal for me !"
1,5,This is my favorite pedal...and I have a ton. Lots of high end pedal and this a cheap (only in price) pedal! Great bluesy tones....sweet and warm when the drive is down...mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up. Like a cranked tube amp. If you play the blues...this is your pedal. I'm sold. I've purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals.
0,2,"I've owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one I still have on my pedal board is the Boss Super Overdrive...Sweet Baby is well on the way of living up to that legend as well. I have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal. It really does react to your playing style. Unlike other overdrive pedals I've used this one really gets smooth when you back off of your string attack and starts to growl the harder you dig in. As far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of them...instead of a tone knob they call it ""focus"", there is also a volume and drive knob. The sounds I can get out of the Sweet Baby are some of the best I've ever used and easy to dial in. I own a lot of pedals but lately I keep my chain setup real simple...the guitar goes into a EHX-Crying Tone wah pedal, then the Sweet Baby, then a Boss Super Overdrive (used as a lead solo gain boost... I don't use Distortion pedals.), next is an MXR Micro Chorus followed by an MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay. The whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my Fender Deluxe Reverb amp. I use the foot switch that came with amp to turn on the tremolo when needed... I play mostly Blues and Classic Rock. The Sweet Baby is well made and I don't see it failing me anytime soon. You can spend hundreds more on name brand pedals but what works for me at the end of the day is alive and well in this ""clone"" overdrive tone blender...Update: this pedal has since been returned. It went out with me on a few gigs and didn't hold up to life on the road. The connections inside the box came loose and became a major problem before a few gigs...I have since put my Boss Super Overdrive back in the chain...while I truly loved the tone from this product in the end you get what you pay for."
1,5,"If you don't like too much dirt in your tone, this might be the pedal for you.The Sweet Baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonally.If you have a fairly clean single channel amp, it won't give you the full crunch or theextra sustain specially at low bedroom levels.  However, if you set your tube amp towhere it just starts to break up or is already cooking, step on this pedal and you'll be rewarded. If you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp, set the gain low and boost it with this pedal. The notes ring clear with the extra bite, and brightness to cut thru the mix.......sweet! You can use it like a Tubescreamer although the Sweet Baby doesn't color your sound.  (No mid-hump)I use it to boost my Barber Direct Drive, OCD and the dirt channel on my amp.The pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made.  It's not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives.  Instead of a tone knob, it has a ""focus knob"" which controls your picking dynamics and presence.  All the way to the left, the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp.  All the way to the right, when you pick the strings hard, it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence.  The pedal is very transparent, smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well.You can't get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with.This pedal basically takes the sound of your amp, adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control.  I just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob.  At a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after, it's a no brainer."
1,5,"I bought this based on video reviews on the net.  My first impressions:To my ears, if the OCD / Ultimate OD simulates ""fat"" power tube distortion, this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube pre-amp, with a bit of edge, sharpness, the kind of edge the tube amps have.  The focus knob seems like a tone knob, maybe more in the upper mids than the treble, but it does the job well.I wish it had a bit more gain.  Surprisingly, this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10, gives me a great metal tone all by itself!  If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost, it gets me exactly where I'd want to be (a dry, tight metal tone, kinda 5150ish.  And while this isn't the purpose of the pedal, it is how I've ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps.  It's tight, its raw, there is no fizz and no boomyness, just a healthy low end.  Crank the knobs on this thing to 10 and you have a very aggressive, tight tone that makes even my Marshall Class 5 tight and grindy enough for Scandinavian style metal.Over all though, this is great for lightly distorted / edge of distorted sounds.  It gave my clean tone a sharper, more ""amp like"" tone (that is, midscooped slightly with the tone knob in the middle.) I think this would be great for Hendrix covers on his cleaner stuff, it just has that chimey, vintage amp character (very early marshalls, older fenders) with the ability to go from clean to dirty with simple attack variation.  If your clean channel is overly ""flat"", this will liven it up to more ""sharp"", scooped tone, which to my ears sounds more vintage.Basically, from Hendrix to modern de-tuned metal (with a definite mids emphasis - not ""80s marshall mids"" but  modern mids emphasis)."
1,5,"Wow.  I have been impressed with a lot of Joyo's products, but their Sweet Baby Overdrive was one that came highly recommended, and hasn't disappointed.  I held off a little bit until the price came down, but the truth is that this thing is worth every penny it's sold for, and then some.As the description says, this is a ""mild overdrive"".  It won't give you the ""Brown Sound"".  It's not meant for metal.  It's almost like adding a tube-amp ""gain"" knob to your existing rig, add subtle yet dynamic saturation and sustain to an otherwise clean tone.  Chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out.  Unlike many ""tube"" overdrive pedals, this thing has tons of volume on tap.  You can set the ""Drive"" to 0 and still have a nice loud clean boost.  Turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock.  But I think of it more as an enhancement to your clean tone, as opposed to an ""effect"" that transforms it.  In that respect, it actually reminds me of the BOSS OD-3 Overdrive, which is a vastly underrated pedal (though the OD-3 probably offers more gain).The Focus knob is interesting - it doesn't act exactly like a tone knob.  As you turn it up, it doesn't remove bass, but changes the gain structure a little and opens up the tone.  The lower settings are bluesy - the higher settings are bright and dynamic.  But chances are, both will sound good.There are some concerns you could have about the build quality - the switch may not be built to last 20 years, and having to remove 4 screws to get to the 9V jack is annoying.  I also wish they'd put the 9V adapter jack on top instead of the side.  But those are mostly minor gripes.  It's an excellent overdrive and an incredible value."
1,5,very nice compressor.  I leave it on all the time and it really improves my tone/sustain.  Can be fairly subtle or can provide significant squish if you want that sort of thing.  Quiet - much quieter than other compressors in this price range.  No concerns here
1,5,"Fantastic pedal, especially considering the price. Prior to this pedal, I've used an MXR Dyna Comp and a TC Electronics Nova Dynamics compressor. This is low-noise compared to the MXR and simple to use. It doesn't get as &#34;squashy&#34; as other compressors, so don't plan on getting this if you want something other than a fairly transparent compressor for extra sustain and unified output."
1,5,I'm sold. I've purchased several JoYo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals.
1,4,"Very transparent, with great sustain and a hint of &#34;dirty&#34; boost if you crank the knobs to max.Built well, sounds good and does what you'd expect."
0,1,"Let me just start out by saying that I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. I still own most of these units except for this one...the JoYo compressor. My setup is a very simple one...starting with a Stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. I don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals I've tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them. This thing simply didn't work right out of the box. While the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from China. Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. I ended up sending it back for a full refund. I don't in anyway blame the seller. They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them again...just nothing with the name JoYo on it. If you're only buying these based on price I would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for."
1,5,No way this thing cost lest than $40.  I needed a small pedal board and didnt want to put a lot of money into pedals so I gave the Joyo pedals a try and I am pleasently surprised.  This compares to my other compression pedals I own...in a metal case???? BONUS.  I'm super happy with my Joyo pedals.
0,2,The unit I received did not work. I returned it. I like the other joyo pedals I ordered so I am going to give this one another shot.
1,4,"It could use a little more on the sustain side like my mxr, but it does what it is supposed to."
0,2,"Although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked, the attack knob (the control for how much compression you want to apply) did absolutely nothing. I even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting.Perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one, but none-the-less I returned the pedal back to Amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board."
1,5,"This is probably the best pedal purchase I have ever made.  I'm not familiar with more expensive compressors and how they might be noticeably better, but this one sounds exactly how I would expect a compressor to work.  It just makes things sound solid.  I've watched the wave envelope it puts out using Audacity and Adobe Audition and the compression works as advertised."
1,5,Great price for a carbon copy pedal. Just buy it you wont regret it. It beats spend gobs of cash that you could spend on other things
1,4,"I've had this for almost a year. While I'm no stranger to compression as far as recording and pro audio goes, I haven't used a compressor pedal since Washburn made that really janky, noisy compressor pedal in the late 80's. I have never used a Ross, so the fact that this is supposedly a clone didn't have any influence over my decision to buy the Joyo. I will say that it's not a pedal that should be reviewed the first time you use it. Sure, I love to love my gear right out of the box just like others do, but compression takes time to dial in, even if you are familiar with it. That said, I finally love this pedal and feel that I can accurately say that it has made a tremendous improvement in keeping my signal tamed when going from clean to overdrive/distortion. I bought it mainly because I play in a Rush cover band, and the harmonics at the beginning and end of Red Barchetta sounded flat and lifeless until I got the Joyo dialed in. Compression isn't the easiest effect to dial in, but once you're there, you can pretty much leave it set as long as you're using similar pickups if you happen to switch guitars. Great pedal once you get it dialed in. Take your time and you will probably be as happy with it as I am."
1,5,"Everything I wanted and more. I love the joyo pedals. They are amazing and they don't break the bank, awesome"
0,1,"It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp.  Not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk. When received the package did not appear to be damaged, but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument."
1,5,"As thrilled as I have been with the Chinese-made Joyo overdrive and distortion pedals I've tried out in the recent past, I felt like the JF-10 Dyna Compressor was somewhat of a risk.  I had been using the very excellent MXR Custom Comp already, but was frustrated with its lack of external controls and versatility.  Also, it's one thing thing for Joyo to ""clone"" the circuitry of a distortion pedal, but could they do it accurately with an ""always on"" effect like compression?Well, Joyo has absolutely done it, and they've done it well enough that I'm selling my MXR.  Compressors are hard to explain, and even harder to demonstrate on a YouTube video, so let me offer my explanation of what this pedal does, and why you should give it a try for only around $40.The primary effect of compression is to ""level"" or normalize the output across frequencies.  Particularly with a clean signal, aggressive playing can lead to annoying volume swells.  Also, certain notes sustain, while others seem to die out too early.  Compression ""smooths"" over these problems and levels everything to a polished, presentable sound.The secondary effect of compression is that the pedal can sustain single notes and chords by increasing their level after they would normally die out.  In this area, the Joyo JF-10 is superior to many other compressors because it gives you ""Attack"" and ""Sustain"" knobs.  ""Attack"" refers to how soon the compression effect kicks after the note is struck.  Turning the knob up produces a ""chicken picking"" effect where the note is very clear and pronounced.  Adjusting the ""Sustain"" knob, obviously, increases the length of time that the note or chord continues to play at volume.  Like most compressors, there is also a ""Level"" control to change the volume of the compressed sound.Of the compressors you can actually find under $100 (such as the MXR Dyna Comp and BOSS CS-3 Compression Sustainer), I like this one the best.  The MXR models have a good clarity of tone, but with only two knobs, the lack of customization is a problem.  You may want high sustain or attack for playing U2-type guitar parts, but might find excess sustain too ""messy"" for punchy AC/DC riffs.  The Joyo allows you to make this change easily.The BOSS CS-3 is a good pedal that has controls for attack, sustain, and also tone, but the pedal produces a lot of noise, and the resulting tone sounds too digitized.  Also, a ""tone"" knob on a compression pedal strikes me as an admission that the pedal is CHANGING your tone, which good compression really shouldn't do.  The Joyo Dyna Compressor sounds like MY guitar and amp, it just puts some polish on the final product, and allows me to add sustain and ""punch"" if I see fit.  Great pedal, and amazing value!"
1,4,"I have a love/hate relationship with compressors. For $40.00, you can't go wrong with this one. I use it a lot on my practice rig. If you need a top notch compressor, hands down the Keeley 4 knob. I use a Keeley in my live shows. Expensive but worth it. As for this Joyo, I can't complain. It does it's job pretty good but it does color your tone some what. True bypass is nice, it's noticeable in your chain, but not to much to take it out. I love for my practice rig. Good buy if you're on a budget (all us musicians are) just don't expect to blown away by it. For $40- give it a shot, I did and don't regret it :)"
1,4,"Joyo continues to surprise me. This thing is all metal, looks very sleek, is true bypass, and all around works well.The individual bands actually light up, which is pretty cool.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch. You can see the led on nearly every other Joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look. However it doesn't even show up in the product picture on amazon. It wasn't a big deal, I just drilled a little 1/8&#34;ish hold and it fits through."
0,3,EQ is great but good luck changing the battery - Lid is too small (or I just have big hands - LOL
1,4,"For the price, this lil guy does the job.  I got this to add to my pedal board and it seems to do a good job boosting the mids and highs that seem to get lost in the pedals and cables.  The pedal is somewhat cheaply made, the jacks don't really seem to fit the housing so well, but i do have it somewhat semi-permanently fixed to the board so i do not think that this will be an issue."
1,4,"I was hesitant to pick up an overdrive or delay from Joyo but took a chance on the EQ.  I really like this pedal and it does exactly what it should.  I use it mostly as a boost with a slight shaping of the EQ but it can be used to get a scooped sound, mids boost, hi/lowpass or whatever you need.  It's a quiet pedal and claims to have true bypass.  When the pedal is engaged the 6 lights for each band come on and they seem sturdy enough.I would just subtract a star because it seems a little strangely designed.  Not the performance side of the pedal as far as I can tell, but for example, the ""N"" on the ""IN"" label on the right is backwards, and it comes in a weird box with plenty of Engrish so I'm skeptical as to how it will hold up to being stomped on.  Time will tell, but for now it seems like a great box for the money."
1,5,I like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments- I run this through a Furman pedal board and there is little to no noise - for the money this is a good product-
0,3,"Alright, it was $30 not $130 - I already had a pretty low expectation bar so would say it gets the job done but not the most &#34;sound-sculpting&#34; investment you could make. As a mid range, lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though."
1,5,"true bypass, doesnt color your sound at all when turned offzero noise, none at allvery useable bands, and useable amounts of gain50+ years as a gigging guitaristmy ears have always liked a lot of midsunfortunately, most amps and modelers consider &#34;mids&#34; to be a much higher frequency than what i consider mids to bei love a nice &#34;bump&#34; in the 800 mhz frequency and this pedal delivers that perfectly.great pedal at a great price"
1,5,For not a whole lot of money it does what more expensive EQ pedals do. Its well made and sturdy with a metal body.
1,4,"When I tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent. Noting that this product comes from China the first thing I suspected was cold solder joints.  I warmed up the soldering iron and opened 'er up and YES!  not only were there cold solder joints but there was a small piece of loose wire shorting components at random. Typical of quality control in the People's Republic of China. A little touch-up with the soldering iron and it's back to normal, whatever that is.  I'm a bit disappointed with the octave but I'm keeping it because it's a good fuzz (and I voided the warranty).  The Normal/Mid-Cut switch is part of why it's a great fuzz.I think I'll replace the Fuzz control with a pot that provides a wider range before going into supersaturation but the rest of the controls I'll leave alone.Dislikes:  quality of Chinese products is a crap shoot.Likes: it's a good, affordable effect"
1,4,"The Joyo pedal looks kool and has some kool features but those are the main pros. Ive never been a big fuzz kind of player but i figured its only $40 so why not? The first thing i learned about this pedal is It does what it's suppose to do but with some drawbacks. There is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal. If you go this pedal and didnt have a noise suppresser you'd be up the creek. Although it is a fuzz pedal is it does ""fuzz"" things then that's why I give it 4 stars. I deduct 1 star because the loud feedback. But in the long run I would just check other pedal out and look for a better alternative."
0,3,"This pedal sort of let me down a bit.I really cannot find a musical sounding adjustment,I can hear a small amount of octave when I adjust it but it is mostly a fuzz pedal with a mid range cut switch.If this was more of an octave pedal I would have been entirely more into the way it sounds.I kept it because to be honest it is very cheap.Why bother sending it back? It is a very good paper weight and I have even used it as a hammer and pounded nails in with it.Lets face it,If someone breaks into my house I can whack them on the head with it and knock them out.I just cannot get any octave sounds idk am I missing something? Joyo I like your other pedal but this one makes me want to punch your entire company in the mouth."
0,3,"I got this from a ""direct from china"" vendor.  When it arrived the volume pot was not working.  It would only operate at about the first 1/4 of travel and then die off.  I was ready to give up but on the second day it just started working(???).  So I don't know if it's a fair representation of these pedals.  I have two other fuzz's(Swollen Pickle & MXR 108 Classic Fuzz).  To me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed.  The Octave feature is a little useless for anything other than lead work and the mid-cut makes it a bit nasal sounding.  Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty cool pedal but it's not as nice to my ears as my other two fuzz pedals.  But those pedals are about $100+ so if you just want to play around with a fuzz pedal this might do the trick.  But do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon.  All in all I think if you really want a quality fuzz pedal you might be better off somewhere else.  I own a few other joyo pedals that I love but to me this one is just OK."
0,3,"I am a fan of Joyo-  I own the vintage OD, the Ultimate Drive, the Sweet Baby, the US Dream,  the Crunchbox clone, and this one.  This is probably my least favorite Joyo pedal.  I'm giving it 3 stars for the fuzz it delivers on the cheap, but the octive leaves much to be desired.  I have read that there is a simple mod that will correct the octive issue.  Apparently, one of the components is installed in a reversed positon, which results in the lackluster octive.  I haven't taken mine apart for the fix, but I read that it's just unsolder, flip, and resolder the same component.  You can google it for better instructions.  Still, this ain't bad for the pocket change they charge.  The reason I haven't fixed it yet is I have the feeling that once I mod it, it will sound just like my Dano French Toast- albiet with a sturdier case and true bypass-"
1,5,I can bear it and dig it cause fuzzy wuzzy was a bear and it is green like the frog ....dig it.  I must have gotten a really good one cause mine sounds great and is nothing like those on You Tube that sound so bad the only bad in mine is that what comes before behind and it is bad @55
1,4,"For the price, this is an amazing pedal. The sound from a $40 pedal is outstanding, much better than I ever expected.The Voodoo is a fuzz pedal, meant to give a sort of Jimi Hendrix sound. This pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave. Alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like Hendrix. I was able to hold a note for two minutes with this box, the sustain is big. All was not completely perfect, it might be me and the way I'm adjusting this, but I had a bit of trouble with feedback.From a sound standpoint, this is a great value and does a good job of fuzzing up my sound. Combined with Joyo's California, Hendrix is almost in the house. (Joyo JF-15 Guitar Effect Pedal California Sound True Bypass)I have a Boss ME-70 multi-effect pedal. This Joyo single effect pedal blows away my Boss pedal, I'm almost sad to say that. I don't have experience with other single effect pedals, so I can't make a comparison to those more costly pedals.I have a Marshall Amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers. My guitar is a Gibson Les Paul 2008 Standard Plus.From a construction standpoint, these are remarkable for the price point. The whole thing has a good weight. The base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it. The box is a solid cast metal box, with a very heavy metal base. The bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box. The 1/4 inch input and output jacks are really sweet - there is a metal insert that screws into the plastic internal jack. It looks to me like it would be very hard to break this jack - that outer ring is heavy duty. The pots look really good. For this pedal, they went with press on knobs. If the knob ever breaks, they are a very easy replacement at Radio Shack. The only weak point is the somewhat thin Mid Cut toggle switch. Given that it is between three knobs, I think it would be hard to break this switch - but it is a little lighter weight than I would like.The pedal comes with a 9 Volt battery. It also has a standard 9V power jack on the side, to use an AC adapter or large rechargeable battery pack.This is not a high end pedal, at this price point, nobody should ever expect that. But darn it, this is one amazingly nice pedal when I consider price. Well worth the investment.The GateShop provided me with a sample of this pedal for review."
1,4,"This one sounds a bit nasal, and thin on guitar. I tried it on bass, and it gives you that big raw, ad thick stoner metal bass sound. I like it!"
0,3,"ok pedal.,,,,it does very good at bedroom volume,,,,,but at cranked Marshall stage volume, I do not like it,,,it does not play well then,,,the octave gets crazy..and screamy,,the fuzz becomes irritating  at loud volumes...,,,I got a Bonamassa Fuzz Face,,,end of search,,,"
1,4,This pedal provides the classic octave distortion I sought after. For the price and product quality you can't go wrong with this one. And the functionality is great! Use it as a fuzz/distortion independently or switch on the octave up for the classic Jimi Hendrix like tones and harmonics
0,3,"This device sounds okay, its usable. But you should plan ahead if you're in the USA and want one, it ships from mainland China, it takes a while to get to the States."
0,3,"I'm not sure what I was expecting.  This definitely is a fuzz, but the one I got doesn't seem to have much in the way of subtlety.  It's either nothing, a lot, a lot more or way too much.  It's not bad and it's probably just my personal preferences, but this just isn't my cup of tea."
0,3,Not the greatest pedal..  Gives a really broken sound.  There is no mid way on this pedal either...  It seems its either all out fuzz assault or nothing.  The octave is a joke.  Having said all that I could see this pedal really shining with a punk sound where bar chords are in abundance.
1,5,"Definitely worth the $40. If you are looking for a literal octave pedal this ain't it. This is a good old school fuzz monster, and when combinations of notes are played, most notably an interval of a 4th on the lower strings it creates an overtone series that has a subtle octving effect. I've used this pedal to put some growl in my bass, kind of an E.H. Bass Balls sound."
1,5,I love this it's do fun to play with. Every pedal that I buy of joyo amaze me. They are well built with a sound that is beautiful for that price. I'm sold out on joyo pedals.
1,4,"Kenny Wayne Shepherd - ""Blue On Black""Nail the lead - use a Strat in the neck position.Gets close enough to fake it for a club band.Sounds pretty close to the more expensive models from Chicago Iron.This pedal will save you $300 or more from the CI model - and it's close enough.Some are concerned with the switches - I am running it in an FX loop pedal - so it rarely gets the button pushed anymore.I have the Joyo Ultimate OD also - nice pedal - I think I like this little company."
1,4,I've got several guitars and CAPOs - this one is not too bad. I would still prefer classic style. Seems like spring is a bit too strong. Price is great thou!
1,5,Easy to use from day one and I am a beginner at the guitar - would recommend it to any one.
0,3,"I bought this in order to have one in my 12 string guitar case. I like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases. It works okay for 6 string guitars, but not even okay for 12 string guitars, plus the spring, became loose. You get what you pay for in this case."
1,4,This works fine on a standard guitar.  No issues whatever.  I see other reviewers having issues.  Not sure if that's from rough handling.  But for casual use this one is completely fine.
1,5,Looks better than the expansive one my Grandson has.  He keeps using MINE!!!  Arrived early and is of great quality.  Fits my VERY old acoustic just right!
1,5,"I have purchased about 5 of these in the past 4 years. I have found no major issues with any of them. Expect to do a small amount of fretwork, such as filing and finishing some of the fret ends, checking the frets for crowns, filing those down and polishing the frets. As with any neck, even the high dollar ones, the truss rod will likely need minor adjustment after it is strung and set up. They come unfinished but well sanded. I sand a bit extra, but one could spray it out of the box. I like to use 3 coats of amber and 6 to 9 coats of clear lacquer, satin or semi gloss. None of these are select quarter sawn wood, but they are an excellent bargain for anyone wanting to build a guitar or replace a broken neck on an instrument."
0,3,well it is worth the money in my opinion however i had to take about a quarter inch total off the sides for it to fit the pocket not that difficult really. the stripe needed to be sanded flush good thing it is not pre finished. the rod had to be  adjusted to get proper relief and the headstock is a little larger than a fender. for the price worth the small effort it took to get it rockn
1,5,Fretted Maple Fender(R) Telecaster(TM)-style Neck with Truss Rod this is one of many fender necks I have purchased from this company I have built several telecasters and fender P bass and Stratocaster bodies all so far have been great to play the quality in the wood is great. I have purchased Womack&#8217;s in the past granted there superb necks but there price is way over the top. When I must replace a neck I think for the money this isa great way to go JohnJ
1,4,"I have yet to install this neck, but have purchased enough necks over the years to have a really good idea of what to expect. There is little to no evidence of corners being cut, just to start. Materials and labor all look good to great. Measuring for fit and specifications is on the money. Not having the mounting screw holes drilled is actually a plus as most &#34;econo necks&#34; seem to be off by at least 1/8.&#34; I'd rather have the trouble of drilling them from scratch than having to plug them with dowels and re-drill. Frets look good, and nut looks good. Until I can install it, I can only really vouch for 4/5 stars.Long story short is this neck looks better than many I've had that cost 2X as much, or more. Unless it has a twist or hump, it actually earns the 5th star. Even if the frets need a little cleanup, it still earns the 5th star. While some may not like the flatter radius, I'd argue that it makes it easier to get the frets in so that they aren't as much of an issue. And it is clearcoated - maybe not a nice amber finish, but most more expensive necks may have no finish at all. So again, another reason for the 5th star."
0,3,"The neck is  well made . the fit ..it was press fit to my body like they were made at the same time.I did have to sand the neck a little , it had a bump in it .. the frets are a little sharp but not as bad as most ..it took some time to get so if you in a tight build time i might look at getting somthing thats made in the states !!"
1,4,"I like the capo, only it seems a little stiff when opening it up to put it on or take it off.  It was actually a bronze color instead of gold, but that's not a big deal to me.  I'm interested on the durability of this, but for the price, how can you go wrong?"
1,5,It arrived on time and was as described. Price was very reasonable.  It is easy to use with one hand and does the job.  Not sure what else can be said about a capo.  They either work or do not.  The other aspect is longevity and only use and  time will tell that.
0,3,A three star at best. I was not impressed with the finish or feel and I use a capo often. You can count on the price telling you of the quality of this product.
1,4,I think I got a great buy love the color and it has a strong spring holds very well great price
1,5,I like this a lot better than others that i have.  Easy on and off and stays put. It's worth the money.
1,4,Great Capo.  Like the color.  Good clamp pressure and this design wraps around the back of the Guitar neck so it does not show.
1,4,"Felt kind of too stiff and rigid to put on a guitar at first, but the more you use it, the more it will wear in (pretty redundant sounding, I know.) The color advertised was not the one I received."
1,5,This works well with the mandolin.  It is certainly an easy change.  I would recommend it &/or purchase again.
1,4,"A friend gives his time to help kids learn music. .He mentioned the need for one, so Got it. It appeared to be built well and I've not heard any complaints about the performance. Not very helpful sorry!"
0,3,"I disliked having to wait a month to receive what I could've gotten at my local music store. The capo does what its does. These capo, I know, will lose their tension in time. I thought I had chosen a different capo. That's what happens when I stay at the computer too long without my glasses."
0,2,"Can't hold tightly on 1st string (low C), a little buzz."
0,3,"Eh. I wish I had more of a passion to play it, but....ehh. It's not bad if you want a uke, but it's pretty small. I don't know what I was expecting. I don't know shit about ukuleles but I do know get a bigger one if you're not comfortable with small frets. If you wanna be that one fat Hawaiian guy, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, go for it. but I think he played a little bigger uke than this, lmao."
1,5,I'm a seasoned player of almost 10 years. I have owed a 300 dollar martin soprano uke which I had to sell in a time of need for rent money. I've been sad ever since. I'm in a tight spot now and just wanted something to play. I just got this uke today. Now aesthetically this uke isn't as pleasing as say a martin sorpano...but..... it sounds amazing for the price. nice bright sounds perfectly intonated too! I have owed a lot of cheaper ukes in the past too and they all sucked bad with horrible intonation. This ukes sound is at least as good as a 50-100 dollar uke! seriously impressed. I see they make a mahogany version i think du200? which is basically this but with mahogany which has a little bit of a brighter more bassy full tone. I may get one in the future its only 40-50 bucks on here amazing! anyway this uke is 29 bucks you get a uke made of nice solid maple wood over all a nice full tone which gets good volume well intonated too!I see some people complaining about the strings....and how it goes out of tune fast.when i got my martin soprano which wasn't cheap it did the same thing. best thingis to stretch out your strings nylon strings take a while to stretch out and set beforethey hold a tune for a long time.Anyway this diamond head DU-150 soprano is probably the best affordableukulele i have ever played. Its perfect for even us seasoned players who happento be broke poor artists! excellent!!!!!!!!!!! would recommend this brand to anyone!
1,4,"This is a good budget uke. I'm not a ukulele expert; to me they all sound a little toyish. This one has better tone and projection than some of the ones I've played in stores. I haven't tested it with scientific instruments or anything, but I have a good ear (former professional tuba player, current music teacher, enthusiastic amateur guitarist) and the chords sound nice and in tune to me. The tuners are cheap, but they are geared, which is nice, and it stays in tune decently. It's not the Stradivarius of ukuleles; the finish is pretty bland, and the sound is not exactly a revolution.  I have used it to teach a class for teachers on using music in their classrooms, and it performed well. My experience with offshore budget instruments leads me to believe that quality control may be spotty, but I only have the one, and it is good. It is neck heavy, but they all are in my experience, and it seems pretty sturdy, although I've been very gentle with it."
1,4,"I recently ordered 5 different ukulele models while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as I wanted to give them a few options.Okina UK100 Soprano Ukulele with Rosewood Fingerboard - NaturalDiamond Head DU-150 Ukulele, NaturalMahalo U-30OR Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele (Orange)Lanikai LU-11 Soprano UkuleleKala KA-15S Mahogany Soprano UkuleleThe Okina, Diamond Head and Mahalo were all under $30 at the time and within $2 price of each other.  Of the three, I thought that the Mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality.  The Okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own 20- and 40-year-old ukuleles (which had the original strings).  A string upgrade to Aquila strings helped significantly, but even then, the Okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level.The Diamond Head and Mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings, and each includes a nice (for this price) little gig bag.  The Mahalo has the most ""island"" look to my eyes and the best sound.  Much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the Diamond Head's.  That being said, it still makes financial and practical sense to get the Mahalo since it's so near the same price (compared to the  Diamond Head) and has heavier strings already installed.  I've also reviewed the Lanikai and Kala on their own pages.On an almost irrelevant note, the Diamond Head was the only instrument of the 5 to arrive in something close to actual tuned-up string tension.  It takes several days for these nylon strings to stretch and settle in, but I didn't have to retune the Diamond Head so much because it was already virtually in tune.  This would not be my primary concern with purchasing an instrument for myself but may be a significant headache-saver for a non-musician parent purchasing a ukulele for a young child."
1,5,"I got 2 of these for grandkids.  They are all right.  I felt as if the uke was well worth the low price.  Like any uke, strings take a long time to set --- sometimes feels as if they never will.  probably would be improved with a set of Aguilas.  Buy a clipon tuner, too.  Snarf makes a great one that has both the vibration-sensing mode and a microphone, can be set for various instruments or chromatic, AND has a metronome function --- and they are so inexpensive!"
1,5,"Awesome instrument. It stays in tune and is fun to play. The best $29 that I've spent in a long time. After a week, I'm already playing songs and I'm not a string player. Don't purchase this without buying a tuner. I bought the Snark SN-6 Uku tuner. It's awesome too."
1,4,"(star rating based on price) great for home use, but dragging it on the road i dont know how long it would last."
1,5,The cradle guitar stand was for a friend. He was happy with the cradle guitar stand. Hasn't had any problems with it.
1,5,"First off this stand is a guitar stand that is cheap and it does what it is supposed to: it holds your guitar.  One thing it has that was a surprise to me was a rubber thing to hold the guitar in at the top which was a bonus.  I use it for my Mitchell Acoustic and it holds it perfectly.About the effects on finish.  After Googling it, calling where I purchased my guitar, and reading the little tag on the stand, the foam on this and many other stands may affect &#34;Nitro Cellulous Laquer Finishes.&#34;  How do you know if you have this finish? Basically the value of your guitar and/or the age.  This finish is used mostly on high end guitars in the thousands of dollar range and some vintage guitars and vintage reproductions. It is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars.  It is a finish that is actually sought out by people who know of it as it is like a hybrid of gloss and satin as the tech at GC told me."
1,5,"came in oversized boxes but were packaged securely and easy to set up and hold my guitar and bass right out of the box,"
0,1,"UPDATE: received 6 of these. 5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer. It was held by only one small tac weld.I got what i paid for. cheap price and cheap product. no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand, putting a $500 guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart. not worth the time & $ to send it back to amazon. One star only for this product. Good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this. Less than one star for this piece of ......"
1,4,"This is a solid stand, with good adjustability and a thick, decent quality foam to cushion your guitar/bass....its only fault is its price. Amazon sells cheaper versions that are just as good. Simply search  for guitar stands on here and see for yourself."
0,1,This is a cheap stand and I was not surprised to see it had broke less than 2 day after it had arrived. The top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made. I do not recommend this product.
1,5,"Got it for $5.00 bucks and wish I'd bought about 5 more.Just as good as anything else out there,Onlky complant is the adjustment to the neck support does go as low as I'd like,but that's my take on it.Buy if you need a stand.For the money,you won't be disappointed."
1,5,"This is a very simple product, and, as others have stated, you could probably just 'DIY' one pretty easily....but for this price, why bother??? Under $10 and this thing is as good as ones that range from $20-50.  I don't think the material + the time it is going to take for you to make one (about 30 mins-an hour, more if you have to go out and buy all of the materials) is going to be worthwhile versus just ordering this bad boy online and...voila! It arrives two days later, no fuss no muss (assuming you have Prime, because, well, who doesn't these days? ;) )PLUS this will look good on camera."
1,5,"awesome, it does the job perfectly, now my vocals sound way better and clearer. this filter is awesome and for the price can't get any better."
1,4,"Good price.  I'm a little concerned because when I first set it up, the screen drooped down. The flex-shaft arm did not seem strong enough to support the screen in any position.  I was able to move it around, and it's working at the moment, so I'll still rate it okay, but I have concerns over the long run."
1,4,"if you have never recorded vocals with a pop filter you don't know what you are missing. This one works well, gets rid of a lot of the little sounds and all the pops. only bad thing is when it doesnt stay in place, but its usually fine"
1,4,"Its a pop filter, it works well and does the job.  However the neck on this thing is a bit long, so if you are using a short mic stand it may have some extra flex that gets in the way.  Otherwise its a good option at a good price."
1,5,IT DOES THE JOB. It is nice and it fits well on my desktop mic stand and it looks nice infront of my Shockmount that holds my Audio Technica AT2020
1,5,"It works great on my acoustic guitars of various sizes.  It is easy to use, easy to put on, easy to adjust the tension, and lightweight.  When not in use, I keep it parked on the headstock.  The shape and ergonomics are a mix between a Kyser and a Schubb S1.  Five stars all the way.  Highly recommended."
1,4,"I've been searching for the 'perfect' capo for years now and this one's come the closest so far.The capo's well made and doesn't show any manufacturing flaws at all. As delivered, the capo fits the neck of my Taylor perfectly with just the right amount of tension. Some other capos are horrible to attach and grip the neck so hard, I'm afraid it'll dent the fretboard. The Planet Waves capo has a nifty tension adjuster in case you have a different neck profile.I like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around. Nothing's worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simple.It comes with a clip to hold a pick, but it's kind of hard to slip one in, especially with some picks I use.Overall, I think this capo's a winner. It's easy to put on and take off. There's no buzzing and it stays out of my way when I'm playing. That's all I ask for :)"
1,5,"This capo seems to handle quite nicely.  Spring loaded trigger like a Kyser (still my personal fave) but with an added tension adjust adjustment on the spring.  In time this will probably become my favorite as there seems to be some benefit to the tensioner helping to keep the guitar in tune.  The only issue, if you could call it that, was that I have always used the Kyser's that have the non moving side of the squeeze handle above the neck as opposed to under the neck like this one - after many years of playing, muscle memory sometimes has me reaching to the wrong place when adjusting position on the fly."
1,5,"I have been playing guitar for longer than I care to admit. Back in 1966 I went into the music store with my Dad and cherry picked the finest Fender Telecaster in the whole store. Back then they were all handmade, so there were variations, and by spending some time, would yield you an incredible find. So I am not a newbie to playing, or working on guitars. I didn't use this capo on my 66 because I have it apart in order to make exact vintage reproductions of the body.Today's modern guitars use medium jumbo frets. My 66 had thin frets. With the medium jumbo frets they are sufficiently high, that if you check them once fretting a note with something as accurate as the Snark SN 2 All Instrument Clip on Chromatic Tuner you will see that the note moves up one or two bars on the tuner once you fret it. (That is one or two bar above the note you are then fretting) So I must admit my quest for the perfect capo would enable me to adjust it so that the guitar doesn't go out of tune when using a capo.I compared the G7 Performance Capo the Six String Silver, with the Schubb S1 Stainless Steel Guitar Capo for Steel String Guitars, and this Planet Waves NS-Tri-action capo. Although the G7 was substantially built and looked rather impressive, I found it to be too bulky, so it kept getting in the way while trying to play chords. So I sent it back. So now it comes down to the Shubb 1 Deluxe and the Planet Waves. I went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times. I would perfectly tune the guitar with the Snark and then apply the capo. I tried to discern the difference between which one of these would make the guitar go out of tune more than the other. I finally concluded that there was no difference.The Schubb S1 had the ability to be adjusted so fine that it would barely be holding on to the neck. If you set that one at its gentlest setting you could get it to be almost perfectly in tune even with the capo on, but set it that softly, and it would just about fall off the guitar. So that is the last thing that you want to happen in the middle of a performance. The Planet Waves Capo in contrast, even at the lightest setting, was still a solid grip on the neck. I also noticed that the planet waves had a wider spread across the strings and therefore was less critical of the positioning in order to get it right.The Schubb S1 is a well-made product, it has nicely finished metal components, but with its roller ball system of fastening, when you loosen it, for sure you're going to occasionally be dropping it in on the floor. You could say that requires two hands in order to remove it. The Planet Wave on the other hand is a true one-handed tool that makes it easy to remove and to put back on. I tried both of these on one of my other Fender telecasters, as well as on one of my acoustics. I got the same tuning results on all of them. I am very critical and exact so when I say that the tuning results would change when you put on the capo you must understand, that the tuner was only moving one line. Most people wouldn't even bother with that much of an adjustment but I know that there is nothing to compare to a guitar with good strings on it, and to hear the tone and the blend of those strings in perfect tune; perfect harmony rules. You know that feeling when you come to the end of a great song, and you hit your last note and finish with a full chord that is perfectly in tune; there is nothing to compare to it.The planet wave is a little bit bulkier and if I had to get critical of it I would say it does get in the way a tiny bit more than the Schubb S1; although this factor is not such a great difference, as to preclude me choosing one over the other. The way each of them mount and dismount to the guitar does make me lean more strongly to the Planet Waves.I saw other reviews that commented that one type of capo provided a better tone than another type of capo. Tried as I might I could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of. There are so many factors affecting the tone, such as after changing the capo was a guitar body leaning a little bit more one way, then it was the last time. For example was the face of the guitar a little closer to the ear range as compared to the last capo you tested that might've been projecting more from the side of the guitar. I also felt that once the capo squeezes the string down the only thing that is creating tone is the fret line between it and the bridge. So at least between these two I found no total differences.I wanted to say that if you are using medium sized jumbo frets and high action you are really bending the string in order to fret it thereby changing the pitch. I love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings. I'd rather dance across the top like a ballet dancer then scrub heavy gauge strings. To each his own they say. I just consider it important to let you know that I'm conducting this experiment with 8 gauge strings on the Tele electric and 9 gauge on the acoustic. So if you're running a much heavier gauge string with lower action, you would of course have less tuning shift going on, because you could adjust the capo (and both of these have a round adjusting knob for fine-tuning) and be able to adjust it to the point where you are pressing just beyond the level of the frets and not really squeezing it all the way down on the fret board and therefore have less of a challenge in trying to keep it in tune while using a capo. (Although I doubt many are setting it that way but rather squeezing it down to the fret board instead.) Although it is possible with heavy gauge strings that you can fine tune the pressure sufficiently that it will yield a tuned instrument while under the load of the heavier gauge strings creating a strong enough grip at this finer setting so it won't slide off of the guitar like the Shubb does at its lighter setting.Of course all this is predicated upon you not re-tuning the guitar when you change the capo position. That really is the only way to create a perfectly tuned instrument and that is to do a little tweaking when you change the capo position. I'm sure most people ignore that and consider the ever so slightly out of tune instrument is something that is not objectionable and doesn't impede the overall quality of their performance. I find on the other hand, that a guitar which is perfectly in tune takes the music to a level that is not possible no matter how little or much it is out of tune.So I conclusion I find the planet waves easier-to-use and with its longer arm capable of a wider fret board, while at the same time capable of the thinner fret boards as well, as being the one that I highly recommend. Notwithstanding the Shubb places a very close second, and with its slightly smaller size, it does in fact get in the way a little less than the Planet Waves. All in all they both are the best of all the ones I've tried."
1,5,"This Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo is easy to use, and features a micrometer adjustment knob to custom fit the capo to your specific guitar neck, a feature I've never seen on a capo before. It worked excellently on several guitars I tried it on (all with light/extra light guage strings), with no fret buzz or noticeable detuning after removal. The pick holder on the end of the clamp is a nice feature too.I recommend this capo without reservation."
1,5,"Knowing nothing about guitars except that my husband plays one, I got this for my other half.He was very happy with it, said it was an excellent quality capo, only needing a turn of knob to do what it needs to do.  He showed me how it worked; how it gives a different sound to the guitar, depending on where you position it.I would highly recommend this to you guitar players.  My husband is pretty picky about his guitar stuff, and I can assure you he was very satisfied with this capo!Highly recommended."
1,5,Capos are not something that I shop for. I have had two for years. One is a strap type and the other is an expensive K type. It is similar to this one. Yeah...in looks only. This one blows that one away. It has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner. It is not in the way of chords or fingering and it does not cause the strings to go sideways. This is great. I play a Tele and an acoustic Martin. It works great on both. I play professionaly and this is the best thing I've gotten in two years.
1,5,"Having played guitar for 45 years, I have tried and used many, many capos. Back ""in the day,"" it was a bar of plastic held in place by a length of elastic. It didn't work very well but it is what was available to me. Later, some technology was applied to the need for a ubiquitously necessary accessory that would hold all six strings firmly in place (and in tune) as it was placed up and down the neck of the guitar WITHOUT doing anything to damage the fret board or finish of the guitar's neck. Many 'good' capos have been made. Until now, perhaps the best options have been G7 which fails in its 'softness' that allows strings to slip, and SCHUBB which, unfortunately, 'snaps' into place in a way that can injure the neck of the instrument.This new NS TRI-ACTION capo from Planet Waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively.Designed by Ned Steinberger (the ""NS""), the Tri-Action works on a trigger/spring/lever mechanism that works all the way up and down the neck, fits perfectly on the first attempt, holds all six strings firmly in place and does so in a way that causes no abrupt jolt to the neck of the guitar. Both the G7s and the SCHUBBs are better known, more commonly used and more expensive. This is one of those rare instances where what you get is NOT what you pay for. D'Addario, the famous string maker that produces the Planet Waves line of guitar accessories)has done a remarkable and welcome job on these capos. Any guitar player who has gone from one to the other (capo) over time, searching for the one that really does what it is supposed to do all the time, will find this new capo from Planet Waves a welcome tool in the quest to produce clear tones and great sounds on a six-string guitar."
1,5,"Oh, quick note: this capo is meant for instruments with radiused, NOT flat, necks.  That said, it works fine on a non-radiused ukulele.I've been using only Kyser capos for many years now.  They don't fall off, they don't usually pull strings sharp, but they do grip TIGHT and can damage some finishes.This capo is easy on & easy off with the pistol grip, has a correct supportive shape for the back of the neck so it won't damage finishes, and has adjustable tension.  I backed off the tension as much as possible, set it on the neck, made one adjustment and it was perfect.  Since I can adjust the tension, I have no worries about it pulling strings sharp.I only wish it was a bit shorter for Ukulele neck widths! ;-)"
1,5,"To my mind there are three criteria for evaluating a capo:1) It's got to hold with enough even pressure to keep all the open stringsringing clearly, especially in the face of hard picking, strumming, and string pulling.2) The design shouldn't intrude on either my thumb when it's behind the neck or peeking over the fingerboard, or the side of my index finger when I'm at the first fret playing chords or single notes.3) The design shouldn't require excessive hand pressure or too much fussiness to apply, reposition, and remove the capo (especially two-handed fussiness).The Tri-Action capo scored big on all three criteria: It held tight on a variety of acoustic and electric neck widths and profiles, from a Martin OM-1 with a wide rounded shape to a Gibson L4 archtop with a baseball bat-thick and round neck, a skinny SG, a wide and soft C-profiled Ibanez Artist, and an imitation Strat with a hard-radiused fingerboard and classic C-shaped neck.Planet Waves came up with a design that works both ""over and under"": I can squeeze the capo with my fingers with its back snug in my palm or flip it over and use the base of my thumb, making it effortless to position, adjust and remove.The capo's profile is comparable in size to the Keyser, but without the Keyser's protruding high angle arm neccessary to generate adequate spring tension. I've used the Keyser for years and in my opinion the Tri-Action is far easier to apply.The Tri-Action is also much less conspicuous from the front, although it's not quite as compact as the Schubb or those fancy minimalist capos some flatpickers like (I like them too but they're a little more work than I sometimes want).What's remarkable about the Tri-Action is its spring tension that's truly comfortable to apply yet produces a more than adequate string grip. The spring wire is probably 1/16"" thick and I can't imagine it ever losing its tension. The adjusting screw wheel is about a quater-inch wide and textured for an easy touch.The purpose of the tension wheel is not to vary the distance between front and rear capo surfaces, as is the case with some other brands, but to vary the pressure exerted by the rear surface against the neck - and consequently the amount of pressure required to squeeze the capo. The bottom line is you can custom-fit the capo to your hand strength and avoid straining or worse - a painful palm cramp like the one I got on stage once while squeezing the Keyser.The pick holder is also nicely designed: a kind of serrated slit that lets you securely stash a pick at varying depths, equating to how easy it is to pull it out. I think my pockets serve the same purpose even more securely, but it's a nice touch.I didn't think there was a whole lot of room left for re-engineering the largely utilitarian guitar capo, but clearly a lot of thought went into Planet Waves' NS Tri-Action Capo - enough to easily knock my previous go-to capo right off its pedestal.Get one, and sit back and watch the banjo guys sweat when the fiddler calls for ""Done Gone"" in Bb at that next jam session."
1,5,"I use a variety of guitars, from an old '50s gibson acoustic to a new nylon string acoustic. I expected the capo to work well on the narrower neck Gibson, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked well on the 2-inch nut width guitars as well. It has a spring-loaded clamping arm that can have the clamping strength increased or decreased, and this works well. Above the adjustable clamping device is a narrow slit to hold a guitar pick, and there's also a holder for a tuner. I use neither of these, so I have no comment on their usability. But for my use the capo is thoughtfully engineered, and is an excellent product."
1,5,"For years I have used a kyser capo because I like the trigger action.  I have run into a few issues when switching between my 6 to 12 string guitar.  I haven't used it much on my electrics.  Though  I like the kyser, the planet waves tri-action is super slick.  It is extremely easy to adjust and is far easier to squeeze open.  The trigger action is like a hair trigger when compared to the kyser.  A few twist to adjust it and I can easily capo between my 6 or 12 string without any problem.  Light, easy and quick.  I am now a believer.  I'm switching to the planet tri-action.  It is definitely worth the few extra bucks."
1,5,"NS (Ned Steinburger) Capo is different than your traditional Kyser style capo. I really like how it is designed, where it conforms to the neck nicely and feels more a part of the guitar than other capos I have used. It boasts minimal string bending across the frets, where it will stay in tune better up and down the neck. I tried this out and, sure enough, their claim was true. I capo'ed from the 1st fret up to the 10th (where I would actually never use it) and tuning stayed pretty much accurate. There is also a nice slot in the capo to put an extra pick in, just in case you drop the one in your hand. Overall, this is a great product and I give it a high recommendation and five stars."
1,5,"I've been playing guitar and using capos for 23 years.  I've learned this...if you are a serious guitar player there are many ""must-have"" items you need in your arsenal.  One of them is a capo.  By clamping one on a guitar you can raise the pitch and key of the entire guitar relative to the tuning it is in.  Essentially you are changing the scale length of the entire instrument when using this device.  They are quite common, inexpensive and the basic design really hasn't changed in many years...until now.That's where this product comes in.  This capo is great because it doesn't simply rely on a loaded spring to clamp down.  It has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob.  The reason this matters is because, depending on the guitar, sometimes a traditional loaded spring capo imparts too much spring tension (or not enough) when clamped.  Too much clamp pressure can result in squeezing the strings out of pitch.  Not enough pressure can result in annoying buzz and dead notes.  Either one is not good.  This new capo eliminates that in an efficient, effective and economical manner.  I highly recommend."
1,4,"I like this capo because it goes on quickly and there is no pulling the strings out of tune.  A bit large for one of my cases, but it still makes it in there ok.  Seems well made so I am not worried that it will break or need replacing for a long time."
1,4,"While I haven't used a lot of capos in my playing, I have used 4 or 5 different types, and this is easily the best of that batch.While all capos require a certain amount of fiddling to get them to hold the strings down just right on each different guitar, this one was pretty easy to ""dial in."" I had very little trouble getting a position which gave good clear tones from each string without having to mess with tuning.The action of the grip and release mechanism is easy, but it delivers firm pressure to the strings. In fact, the only negative I found was that the height of the capo made it a bit difficult to fret near it on the higher strings on some chords.Overall, this is a very good capo, and I can recommend it without hesitation."
1,5,"The Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo features a trigger action, which makes it easy to put on and remove, compared with any other style of capo I've ever used.  As the product description says, it has a built-in pick holder, which certainly is not necessary, but which is a feature that some users will find attractive.  If the photo on the Amazon product page looks confusing, don't worry.  What looks like a spring actually is a spring.  The spring mecahnism is adjustable, similar to the way that vise-grips work.  This capo is adaptable to guitars with various neck radius shapes, and narrow neck, standard acoustic guitars, as well as acoustics with wider necks (e.g. Godin's Seagull guitars).  The only quibble I have--and it's a minor one--is that when you get the spring mechanism set up for one guitar, you may need to adjust it when you switch instruments.  Once adjusted, though, the downward tension on the strings seems to work well with no fret buzz."
1,5,"Can't say I've tried all of the capos in the world, but I've had my share of the different designs.First I had the bungee cord type, then I had the snap on type, then I had the different capos designed for acoustic, or classical or electrical.This one by far, evolved from good design.The bottom curve portions fits the neck of my guitars just perfectly. The top portion is just wide enough to cover the strings.  The spring allows for adjustment for the optimal tension.The design on this is so that every string receives the same vertical pressure down to the neck. All of the others I have tried use a spring that could pop out (one actually did) and the entire capo came apart.This one even has a pick holder built in.It is light weight, just the right size.I highly recommend this capo if you need one for acoustic guitar."
1,5,"I've had my eye on a G7th capo for awhile, but this became available in the Vine program so I decided to try it.The capo was easy to pop out of the package. The design is simple and easy to understand and use. It is very lightweight and works fine on my Epiphone electric guitar. The capo also has a handy built-in pick holder.This capo certainly meets my needs, and I've removed the G7th from my wish list."
1,4,"I like the adjustable tension of this capo, I don't think its as easy to put on a ""Kyser"" capo of this style, but once on the neck, the Planet Waves NS Tri-Action Capo moves easily, and has even pressure across the fingerboard, a result of the adjustable tension I surmise. Some day I will use the pick holder, not right away, some night when I'm feeling I need my pick held."
1,5,"Over the years I've tried literally dozens of capos. While some have been better than others I've never had one I was completly happy with -string buzz, hard to place without being out of tune, too firm, not firm enough, etc. So far the Planet Waves NS Tri-Action Capo is the best one I've ever tried,at least in the short term. It's worked equally well on my acoustic & my electric. It works on my octave mandolin and, even though it's designed for 6 strings, on my Rickenbacker 12 string. Hopefully it will give years of faithful service & for the quality is reasonably priced. At this point I give it 2 thumbs up. Recommended"
1,4,I have used this on my Les Paul.  It proved to be very functional.  The size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit.  In the past I have used the NS capo which is more compact.  This one is harder to lose because of its size.  I also appreciate the even tension across the strings.  Much better than other capos when it comes to this and is handy if you like to use custom gauge strings.
1,5,"I've been playing guitar for about 7 years now, and I've always used the Kaiser capo, but since I got this planet waves one, the kaiser just gathers dust in my guitar case. Although they're both just tools to hold down the strings on a certain fret, the planet waves is much easier because it uses spring action with little effort, while I can recall the kaiser taking a lot more work to actually get it onto the guitar. Less pressure is involved, and I kind of like the fact that the rest of the capo, that isn't actually barring down the frets, is under the guitar instead of over it. The product conceals itself well to those who aren't playing the instrument and it has great use. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there."
0,3,"[Update 2013-09-24]Star Rating downgraded from 5 to 3 because the pick holder broke (a rather thin and fragile plastic flap that helps to wedge the pick in place broke off).The Planet Waves Capo trumps myKyserin both speed and ease of use. Its triple spring action provides the leverage needed for opening or closing it with much less effort, and it's every bit as well-built as the Kyser. It also has a couple of features that the Kyser lacks:(1) Integrated Pick HolderI'm always losing my picks (God knows how many picks I've run through), so the pick holder is a very, very handy feature!(2) Tension AdjustmentWith the capo attached to myWashburnat the lowest tension, my G-string would buzz. But at the maximum tension, this capo has a stronger grip than the Kyser, which makes for a buzz-free playing experience.---The Planet Waves Capo definitely gives the Kyser a run for its money. For years, the Kyser had been my favorite capo, but having found the Planet Waves, I find myself liking it more than my Kyser. If you prefer a quick-change capo (as opposed to aShubb-style capo), the Planet Waves Capo is well worth considering."
1,5,"I have been using an old elastic-bar capo for years because the last spring capo I used did not have nearly enough tension. When I first applied the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo I thought ""here we go again."" There was ample tension E-G but B and E were buzzy as all get out. Not expecting much, I adjusted the tension. It took a couple of tries to get it just right, but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar... zero buzz across the board. That in and of itself, makes this capo a five in my book. Add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze (on and off), it looks nice (I have the black version), as well as its comparative ease on the wallet, and this capo is a rock solid five star product.This capo also has a pick holder. The feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capo's overall size and shape, but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itself.Get this capo!"
0,3,"The Planet Waves Capo looks like it should work a lot better than it did. I tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other Capos. I used this capo on a Gibson J40, Hummingbird and a J-200. I played it finger style and strummed with a pick. The device is very well made and really looks like the best capo I own. However, the sound left something to be desired. There was fret buzz and the notes sounded lifeless, unless  I really cranked down on the adjustment - then is was still dull, but passable. It was a little better on electrics - I tried it on a Les Paul and a Telecaster - it was OK, but not the best of the bunch. I do like the built in pick holder. To compare this I tried a G7 capo, Kaiser and Schubb. Frankly, the only one I really am happy with is the Schubb."
1,5,"The adjustable tension is a great idea and the open/close lever is designed in such a way that it sits behind the guitar neck and won't get in the way of your hands (unlike the capo I had before this one).  It even comes with a handy pick holder!I could make this review longer, but what else do you really need to know?  If you have a non-classical 6 string guitar, acoustic or electric, this guy should do the trick, regardless of neck shape.  Its a very well designed capo!"
1,5,"I have several capos & this one really surprised me for the price. It's light-weight yet strong and the adjustable grip is great for any neck. Compared to my G7th which costs 3 times more, it is a great buy. I really like Planet Waves products. They are made well & last."
1,5,"I'm a HUGE fan of the two previous NS Capos from Planet Waves. What does this add to the others?Well, functionally I think it works no better than the previous dual action capo. In other words. It's freakin' perfect.So... I'd give it 4 stars... except it gets 5... because...That little clip that holds a guitar pick is absolute genius.Full marks. You can't miss with this product."
1,4,"As a musician, you wonder how accessories like a capo, which have been around for centuries, can be improved. Sure enough, the Planet Waves' Capo has a feature where you can manually adjust the tension. When a capo doesn't have enough tension, it will slide around on the neck when your hand bumps into it which will result in buzzing. Initially, the Planet Waves' Capo required me to play around with the tension and placement on my instrument which caused me some concern at first. I mean shouldn't it just immediately work? After I figured out what worked best for my instrument, the capo worked like a charm. An additional feature of the Planet Waves' Capo is that there is a clip for a pick which is handy if you don't already have an attached pick holder.I like it and recommend it for those who might move their capo around to different instruments that have varying neck dimensions."
1,4,"This capo works just fine. The only downside is the same as with most capos...it requires some fine-tuning to get it work on different guitars. The only one I've found that doesn't is the Kyser...my ""go to"" capo for years. Because of its design, that capo adjusts to any guitar (acoustic vs. electric, thin neck vs thick, etc) easily. The only downside of that capo is that it sacrifices a tiny bit of perfect intonation for the sake of ease of use.This capo has a similar ""pinch"" design (spring-loaded), but doesn't adjust as easily to different guitar/neck sizes. It has a wheel that allows for it to be tightened or widened as the guitar needs. This allows for a bit more accuracy of intonation, but at the expense of ease of use. It's certainly not difficult or extremely time consuming, but it's not a capo you want to use to quickly swap in between songs.So, all said, I still prefer my Kyser. It allows for much faster changing, which for me is worth the slight offset in intonation accuracy. But this might be a better option if you're in a studio or won't ever need to use a capo for more than one song at a time (or don't plan to use it on more than one guitar in the first place)."
1,4,"I did some research on capos and decided to give Planet Waves a try. I previously had one of those bungie cord like capos, which was fine but it is a bit cumbersome.The other capos I looked into were Kyser and Schubb. Kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip. It's disadvantage however is that it has a lot of weighted tension on one side so it can knock your strings out of tune. The Schubb deals with this issue by having an adjustable tension spring that will adjust pressure according to the thickness of the neck. The problem with the Schubb, however, is that it can't really be manipulated with one hand and it can easily fall of the guitar.In comes the Planet Waves. It has a trigger grip so technically you can easily move it around the fretboard. However, because of the adjustable tension, you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness. It might rule out the one-handed ease but it does take care of Schubb's problem of falling off. In reality, I only found that I need to adjust the tension when switching between guitars or if I move up way up the fretboard. Between the 1st and 5th fret, I don't really need adjust. However, if for some reason I want to capo at the 7th, I do need to adjust the tension because it's too tight. In all, it's not that big a deal and it's nice to have the option to adjust the capo.In all, I'm happy. No capo is perfect. You can do partial capos with this one. Another review complained that it created buzz but all you need to do it adjust the tension.In case you aren't aware, this particular capo model only works on six string steel guitars. I have an electric guitar, a nylon and a Recording King ROS-06 with a chunky neck. Works great on the electric with the skinny neck and the ROS-06 with that chunky neck. Since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard, it does not work on classical guitars (or anything with a flat fretboard). The capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved, it will not apply pressure on the middle strings.It's a nice capo but it may not be what you're looking for so I recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos."
1,5,"I am a long-time musician who has been through a lot of capos; some that I hope to never see again :) ... fortunately, things have changed for the better ...What serious guitar players have always needed is a capo that is smart and small, durable, quick change, one hand operation that also has the right tension to make sure there is no string buzz or detuning ... for a while, you could get quick change or tension adjusment, but not both in the same capo ... the last several years have seen manufacturers attempting to provide these key features in one acceptable capo ... now there are many choices out there at various price points and frankly, it gets confusing ...So why this particular capo?  First Planets Waves is a name I have come to trust to provide quality accessories at reasonable prices ... this NS Tri-Action Capo is built sturdy but it is very light and unobtrusive on the guitar neck ... one-hand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner ... so far, this capo covers all the bases in a simple design as well or better than anything else I've tried for the price ...One thing I did not expect is that, because of the design and tensioning, I can use it on Tenor Guitar, Banjo and Mandolin as well ... while I prefer a smaller capo for these other instruments, in a pinch, I can just clip on the NS Tri-Action and keep playing ...I am the kind of guy that when I find something in the instrument world that works, I stick with it for years ... it is possible that this capo may become my favorite ... I just really like the look, feel and features of this smart design ... looks like Planet Waves hit the mark once more ..."
1,5,This capo is easy to install and move and does not seem to pull the strings thus maintaining tune. Adjustment is easy and effective. The same company makes a tuning capo which I find handy at times.
1,5,"I don't often capo my guitar.  When I do,  I need something that goes on quickly and is firm on the neck.  You can't get better than this."
0,2,I dont know what all the hype is over this thing.  The idea is good and its cute.  Its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out.  How many of these types of noise boxes do we need?  Not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it.  Go buy a 20 watt Roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also.  Or any combo little amp.  It's for bedroom use only.  You have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire.  Being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you.  Just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot.
1,5,"When I'm in a apt. I need an amp with tube (at least the pre) and a cabinetOrange PPC108 1x8"" Speaker Cabinetas small as possible, giving a decent sound and output (w/o annoying around) and Orange made my needs true!(I never ever expect to play at a stadium with this! Obviously)In my opinion, this is absolutely a decent Amp that respond to precise needs."
1,4,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a proud owner of:- Gibson ES125 Acoustic/Electric- Pono MSD-E- Blackheart BH5H- Blackheart BH110- A Weber Vintage Series 10A125 (10 inch, 8 ohm, 30 watts) in an open back, solid pine cabinet- A Jensen Mod 10-50 (10 inch, 4ohm, 50 watts)- All tube Fender Tweed ChampNow that you know the gear I have, what I can play through an amp, and what I can plug an amp head into, I'll sum up my review with this:What you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab, the cables you use, and how clean your power is. Got good gear?  This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny.  I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that's bigger than this amp! Still, it packs a punch.  With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half, I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue.  Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go.  Yes, this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have.  If you want to quietly play along with some tunes, you can.  Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube.  Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7.  I understand that's standard.  A JJ is nice, but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone.  Dig out an old Phillips, RCA, Sylvania, or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother.  I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror: warmed it right up; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still, compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ, this guy does sound more solid state than anything.  BUT, compared to a buddy's Roland and solid state Ampeg, it's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects (reverb, echo, chorus) can get noisy. So, if you like pedals, stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters: a previous reviewer is right.  The external power brick for this guy seems fragile.  I'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp. It's holding up, but one round with my cat and I'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance #1:  One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes.  I found that out quickly.  So, get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp.  I'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance #2:  This is a 20 watt amp, right?  WELL... if you don't run a 4ohm speaker, you won't get all 20 watts.  The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output. (Yes yes... don't quote physics to me.)  At 8ohms, I still get good volume.  But at 16ohms (like my BH110) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp.  That said, I'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab. The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ, while nice, can't put out the low notes like I'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean.  But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance #3: The Micro Terror is so small and so light, it'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord.  Unlike a nice 20 pound amp, the chord won't pull out.  So: BE CAREFUL.Mitigation for Annoyance #3: The all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors... though, it will gouge your floor.And then there's the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier: if the power is noisy or ungrounded, you will wind up with hiss no matter what.  I always carry a Monster HTS 350 and run my amp through it; that REALLY helps in cleaning up signal noise.  (If you don't have one, get one.  The 300 & 350 are cheap and they work.)The SummaryAfter all that, I can still say:  I love this little amp!  I've gigged with it and it sings well.  Plus, the added gag of tiny ukulele + tiny amp always draws a laugh... until I crank the dial over and shred some faces.For the price, you can likely afford to pick up $40 worth of guitar/speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig.  And, for the price, this is a solid 4 star amp.  I know I'm happy."
0,3,"BOTTOM LINE: The Orange Micro Terror is powerful hybrid amp head capable of driving any number of speakers you throw at it. It's low wattage guarantees crushing tube overdrive and classic British tones in the palm of your hand.WHY ONLY 3 STARS? For starters, this is what I would consider a ""novelty-boutique amplifier"", because it recreates vintage British sounds like a boss, but it's lack of clean headroom is evident. It's an Orange after all, and so if you want a dirty Plexi sound with only 1-channel to work with - this head is for you. Playing with a Les Paul, I tested it through a Marshall 1960A 4x12 and it sounds amazing. I also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a Celestion G12H30. I was able to find the ""sweet spot"" on the Tone knob, which for me was around 1 o'clock, and with the Volume at noon and the Drive at max... I had entered a very musical, lush, and totally gig-worthy tone zone that Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, and Jimmy Page would have loved to go on tour with. However, as much as I love eating British Crunch for breakfast, I consider myself a versatile player who needs a bright and heady clean channel AND that classic punch'n'crunch we all know and love AND a solid distortion for metal and beyond. Unfortunately, the Micro Terror is a ONE TRICK PONY in the Tone category, and for this (if we're starting at 5 stars) I have to subtract one star. I feel confident subtracting a star for tone because the Micro Terror doesn't exactly take pedals well either without generating too much noise, which leads to feedback. I subtract another star because this head is really only usable if you're in a rock band, already own a 2x12 or 4x12, and want something quick and small to use to rock out with. The problem is, if you're one of those people, you probably already have a solid amp head to drive that 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place. This puts the Micro Terror into Secondary status or useful as an emergency head during a gig if things take a turn for the worse. This leads me to my final point: if the intent is to purchase this as a bedroom practice or garage rehearsal head, then for the price you could get a much better product that has two GOOD channels instead of one simple (but GREAT) one.WHAT I LOVE about the Micro Terror is that it is something you can always keep in your arsenal. Having owned several different combo amps and head/cabinet variations over the years, the Micro Terror could fill that niche because it can be scaled according to your performance or rehearsal needs. If I were starting over from scratch, I'd probably buy two 2x12 cabs, a Micro Terror, and a bigger and more powerful tube head to drive both cabs if needed. This would give you perfect flexibility for band rehearsal, studio recording, small bar, big bar, club, or concert stage venues.(TO THOSE WHO THINK THIS REVIEW WAS UNHELPFUL: I've noticed this review, and pretty much any review of this amp with anything bad to say about it is getting unhelpful votes. It seems like, people want this to be a 5-Star Amp but always with the caveat of ""but it's $150, what do you expect?"" or they begin their rave review with ""For a $150 amp..."". Look, I don't judge gear just by price, I judge it by VALUE and with my EARS first. The reality is, you need a really nice 1x12, 2x12, or 4x12 to really make the Micro Terror sound amazing. If you're dropping $150 for the Terror, and probably another $150~$250 for a great cab... why not spend that $300 or so on a great ALL-tube 1x12 to begin with with 2 channels, better EQ, and the option to route to an external cab from the get-go?)"
0,2,"I have checked this amp out twice, once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8&#34; version, with both a Strat and a Les Paul, and I am very disappointed in this amp.Now admittedly, with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7, however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones.So, without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing...Bottom line: unless you want full on distortion 100% of the time, you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp.... if you are committed to Orange (and boy do they make some stunning amps) go check out the dark terror..."
1,5,"Will be getting the amp in a day or two. At the sale price of $119 this can't be beat. My research on this device said that to make the really good little solid state/tube hybrid even more awesome is to replace the JJ 12AX7 with a Mullard Blackburn vintage 12AX7 (from the 1960's). It can cost around $30-50 a piece for a NOS (new old stock) but will sweeten the sound without adding or subtracting noticeable gain. In the end the Micro Terror should sound just like real tube amps costing many hundreds more.1st UpdateTook delivery and hooked it right up to my Marschall 412 into the 16 Ohm jack. Volume at about8 o'clock and gain at about 3 o'clock. Man, what a great sound. Very tubey! Typical British growl at higher gain settings. Loud. Plenty loud for your bedroom/office/whatever. Turning it up a bit should be more than enough for a gig at a bar. Just be sure to use a GOOD QUALITY SPEAKER CABLE, like the GLS. Will be updating when I get the vintage 12AX7 tube replacement. So far I am very impressed. Honestly, with a sound this good, why buy a TH30 for 5 times the price. Measured how loud this thing is. At about 3 feet in front of my Marshall 1960 lead 4x12 with gain at max and volume at a bit less than 8 o'clock I got around 84 decibels playing strong but not super strong chords. This is too loud for most apt. buildings for sure so better plug in the headphones.2nd UpdateTried out several compatible tubes...ie 12AY7 12AT7 and the Mullard 12AX7. Each will have a subtle or more obvious effect, sound is such a subjective thing you really have to try this out for yourself.  I personally found the Mullard to be the best. Really nice tube sound, typical Orange, sounds as good as most amps costing several times as much."
0,3,"This is a very cheap little practice amp, and I hoped I'd be able to use it with the headphone port and aux in to practice without driving my GF nuts... Unfortunately I have a couple of problems:  the headphone and aux quality really wasn't that great (and using great phones).  The sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier... I just expected this to be a little more versatile than it turned out to be.For quiet practice, you're best getting a VOX Amplug, IMHO.  Sounds great, MUCH cheaper, and integrates external audio better."
1,5,"A perfect fit! Plus it comes with a handle, strap and a nice sized pocket where you can store picks, capos, straps and strings. Its great for getting my uke from point a to b safely. Would recommend it."
1,5,Very happy with it considering the price point.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat as long as you don't need a hard case.  Great for the knock around uke though.
0,3,"It is okay. It serves the purpose. It is a good fit for the soprano uke. A pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week. Not a big deal I just stuck a zip tie in its place. The case is not a cheap trash bag style gig bag but a heavy nylon with some padding to it. It has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear. There is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case. It will keep your uke from getting scratched or dusty, but will not provide much more protection than that."
1,5,This gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique. Definitely far superior to any of the other gig bags that I'v ordered for tenor and baritone Uke in this price range.
1,4,This is a very reasonable price for this bag.  I got it for my les paul epiphone uke.  The fit is fine.  This bag has better padding than the bag that came with the uke.  I'll just give the epiphone bag away to someone who doesn't have one.
1,5,"What a good buy!  This gig bag is nicely made, looks great, and the padding is really nice.  Luv the zip pocket in the front - perfect for strap, snark, capo, whatever.  Bought this for my hubby's tenor uke and one just like it ('tho smaller)for my concert uke.  Highly recommend."
1,5,"This is a very sturdy and well-made bag. Much better for the money than I was expecting. I wish I could find a guitar bag that was this nice! My uke is very cozy inside. The pocket on the outside has a lot of space for your picks, kazoo, ukulele stand, whatever you need to have with you.I carry an iPad around when I play -- the full size iPad doesn't fit in the outer pocket, so I put it on the back of the uke on the inside. An iPad Mini would probably fit."
1,4,Inexpensive and compares favorably with my more expensive tuners. Angle is not as adjustable as a snark but tuner works well.
1,5,This is so darn cool!! It shows which string you are tuning and exactly when you are in tune!! And it works on so many instruments!!
1,5,"Being very disappointing by the sensitivity of the Snark SN 1, I purchased this bargain priced tuner, I could not be more pleased. It has settings for chromatic, bass, guitar, and ukulele. Not only does it have tone dial indicator, but the screen changes color, red for flat, green for just right, yellow for sharp. The screen is also very bright and easy to read. It is very sensitive, no need to constantly move it around like with the Snark SN 1. It is tiny, perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse. I use mine for when I go to the music store and test out ukuleles. This makes a perfect main tuner, or a nice inexpensive backup to more expensive tuners. My main tuner is a Snark SN 8, but this one is just as accurate. The only negatives I can find is that the hinge seems kinda delicate, so you don't want to force it, and the power button is very tiny, but for the size and performance of the unit, those low points are almost irrelevant. Buy a couple, you can get two or three of these for the price of a single Snark or Korg."
1,5,"Great little tuner very accurate and portable!nice bright screen perfect and the price is right!Its nice it has a chromatic tuner on it too as wellas guitar and bass too! very handy! i useit to tune my baritone, concert and soprano ukes !"
1,5,"I ordered the Hola! and the Snark SN-6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church.  I've spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to &#34;settle in&#34;.  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent.  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one.  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone.The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store.  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark.  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need.  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther.  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read.  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are.  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!.Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function.  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off).  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician.  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano.  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes.  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments.The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction.  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark.  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient.  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar."
1,5,"I bought this on a whim to use as a low cost tuner for my Hola! uke...and find myself using it on my six string guitar and four string bass as well. It tunes quickly and easily, with different colors used for when your too high or too low in pitch, and uses green as the color when you nail it, very nice and easy to use. It's also very compact, easily storing in even the tightest of gig bags, even your pants pocket will do for traveling.I highly recommend this if your on a tight budget and can only get one tuner for multiple instruments, it's a bargain and it works great. You can't honestly ask for more!"
1,5,"I love this little tuner. It is smaller than I thought it would be. It weighs next to nothing, is accurate,  and easy to read with its bright large display. It is universal for different string instruments by pressing the botton on the back. The only part of the display that is very small is the one that tells you what instrument it is set for, but that was not a big enough issue for me to subtract points for."
1,4,"I've ordered 9 of these, and only one has been defective. Not worth shipping it back, no big deal. Great tuner for my guitar class! The Snark may have a few more features, but if all you need this to do is help you tune, you're good to go."
1,5,"Liked the fact it tunes your ukulele as I must be tone deaf and cant use pitch pipes,, I bought another for my step son.  I did have a problem with mine not turning on one time but after re-seating the battery it has not had a problem since."
1,4,i like the fact they are colored the helps a set up and break downi am going to buy some more
1,5,"This 6-Pack of Guitar Patch Cables are great for chaining guitar effects pedals and the short lengths helps to reduce cable ""spaghetti mess"". These are well made cables with 90-degree connectors, which is exactly what we needed.Highly Recommended!CFH"
1,4,"They work great with my pedals! Not sure if it's the pedals or the cords, but I noticed with my full rig and using all the cords there is a noticeable hum in the background. I'm sure a noise gate could solve that problem, but oh well. I can deal with it."
1,5,"After years of soldering connectors to custom wire lengths, I love the ease of buying a few packs of inexpensive patch cords and just plugging in. Some of my older pedals are still connected using soldered 90 degree plugs that invite crackle and hum over time - may be due to vibration when packing / setting up or, maybe it's just contaminates in the air condensing on the contact surface. No matter, I won't be getting out the screwdriver and soldering iron again.One advantage of these molded plugs is smaller size - especially when connecting stereo devices. Much narrower than the 90 degree metal shells with screws. A couple of concerns I had were increased noise without the metal connector shell and the restrictions of fixed length. As it turns out, they don't contribute to higher noise levels and, they are just the right length for all my pedal connections. Everything is connected using this single length patch.Love the color coding, too. Especially on the stereo pedals connected in series where you can link the mono and B channels and are looking for that mono output in less than bright light.And what to do if one does fail? Toss it and grab another from the bag of patch cords that cost less than a couple of soldered connectors and is replaced faster than a soldering iron can get up to temperature. I'll always have a bag of these around for spares and reconfiguring my board. It's a lot more fun playing than fixing stuff - love these patch cables!"
1,4,"They all work and none of them have given any trouble. My pedal arrangement stays loose and the whole thing gets moved and jerked around (a lot). I would have liked them to be a little bigger in diameter but for the price they work great. No regrets, Rock On!"
1,4,took longer than I wanted but im in cali and they are in jersey so... when I got the patches they were better quality than I expected. So It was cool.
0,3,These patch cables have worked well and done their job just fine for me but when they arrived they smelled really strongly like band-aids ... kind of a gross plastic smell.  The smell did go away some but it made me not want to touch them much at first.
1,5,"If you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it.  I've tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer.  It is great for a quick way to get electrified.  Lead wire is not very substantial, but if it breaks in the future hopefully I can just buy another one.  To get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp."
1,5,"This is a great little addition to both my violin, and my mandolin.  While some reviews on here have mentioned using it on a ukulele . . . no.  It doesn't work that way, unless the sound hole is not directly over the strings.  If it is, the pickup will mute the A string, and it's annoying.Anyway I digress.  The pickup adds a bright, clear sound to your instrument, without feedback or hassle."
1,5,"For being so cheap, this pickup works surprisingly great. Was just looking for something quick and easy to mic a violin at a decent quality, and this did the job perfectly!"
1,5,"I wanted a pickup for my relatively inexpensive violin. It sounds pretty good for the price I paid for it. I was actually in the market for an electric violin and while shopping Amazon ran across this inexpensive pickup for an acoustic. I purchased it at the same time I bought the electric violin. Naturally when the electric arrived, I laid the acoustic pick up off to the side and went to work on the electric. A few days later I thought I would give the pickup a try. It slides right in and out of an F hole with no problem. I plugged it into my Fender amp with a little reverb and WOW is how I can describe what came out. It sounded like I was in a Great Concert Hall. Of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp. Whatever your amp is capable of, your violin can do it. Now I haven't tried to blow it up or anything but the sound is tremendous. Cant say enough except the price was so low I couldn't have gone wrong too bad."
0,3,"Pros:-Price point--can't really go wrong-Clean signal (no self-noise)-Works for a tunerCons:-For recording or amplification purposes, this thing picks up a LOT of attack noise--fingers dropping on the strings, bow clicks, etc.-Additionally, the clamp does not always solidly grasp the instrument, and shakes around a bit. God help you if you touch the pickup while playing amplified."
1,5,"For an $8 item, you can't go wrong. I used it on a violin to test out some amps at a Guitar Center. It seems very sensitive and transmits a clear tone."
0,3,"I originally rated this pickup 5 stars. However after using it for some time on dulcimers, a mandolin and acoustic guitars, some problems have turned up.Basically the Cherub is just too sensitive. It works well at lower volumes, but as soon as you crank it up, feedback city that you can not stop easily. I put a rubber inner tube from a bike to reduce the sensitivity, but still feed back and funny sound.If you are looking for a pickup to use at a dance or some other loud venue, the Cherub will likely squeal as you crank it up.It sort of makes the whole acoustic chamber of your instrument one big pickup. You can talk into your instrument!"
1,4,"I quite like the sound of this thing, running through a Crate acoustic guitar amplifier. It sounds really natural, and it's easy to dial in a nice sound. It's hard to hear it while you're playing; you're better off dialing in a sound while someone else plays for you, or trusting someone else to set the amp. Like most of these kinds of pickups, it's quite susceptible to feedback, so you can't get out in front of the amplifier and listen. Not a slam on the product-that's just the nature of the beast. I'm an honest to goodness terrible violinist, but I got this to help me teach a large group of elementary school children. It's a beginner class, and hearing the right sound is really helpful. It works great. I don't turn it up very loud-just a little bit of extra push so they can hear me in the back of the room. I hate the &#34;short&#34; cord, and I wish I could use a regular instrument cable, but I can understand that they don't want a lot of weight pulling on your violin. But the cord length means you have to sit pretty tightly on top of your amplifier-unless you use some kind of little pre amp. In fairness, the cord is a reasonable length, but I'm quite tall, so it's 5' of cable just to get straight up to my shoulder."
1,4,Unbelievable clear sounding on a Mandolin.  Can't yet get the sound out of a violin that I want with it but still experimenting.  Will have to find a way to keep the cord secure while it's connected as the slightest movement or adjustment makes a lot of noise.All in all 7$ very well spent.  Thank goodness pickup prices are coming down.  Only a few years ago you could not find a pickup-mic even this good for &#60;100$.  Now if only the price of pickup-chics would come down. :(
1,5,"I have run sound for several large churches, providing services for both live sound and television broadcasting. The way that you have to mix for each of those is vastly different, especially when applying vocal effects. I have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 years.The 80/20 rule says that if you can get 80% of the sound you're looking for with 20% of the work, be satisfied. This Mic Mechanic (MM) is more like 99% of the sound with 1% of the work.I actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound. Primarily because it solves SO many problems that you face as a sound engineer.1) Adaptive tone. The MM continuously listens to your voice and adjusts the compression, gate, EQ, and de-essing. Even when recording dry vocals, at a minimum, you should at least set your compression, then in post production, add parametric EQ to place your vocals where they need to be set.Now? I hit the tone button, and all that is done for me. It makes a dynamic mic sound great! It makes working with a condenser mic easier.2) Reverb. Most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb. They either use too much or too little. With this, when you it equally between wet and dry, you get the right amount of reverb to bring recording to life. I recorded a vocal with club, room, and hall reverb. Each one sat just right! When you solo the vocals, you can tell which is used. In the mix it was more subtle. Good Job!3) Pitch correction. I have to admit, my own vocals aren't perfect. When you record your own vocals, and you're like me, you'll hear a ""chorus"" sound in your headphones. That's because you're hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones. This takes a second to get use to.When set in the center, you can still do your vocal gymnastics, slide into notes, and it seems... natural. It pulls you to the closest not in the chromatic scale, so if you're way off, it will make your vocals sound out.I'm not a singer, but this has renewed my joy in singing!"
1,5,"I have a bad habit of backing off of the microphone when changing chords on the guitar. This little device gives me auto-correct for that habit as well as some nice echos and reverbs which aren't overbearing, and the pitch correction sounds really natural. Now I just need 2 more so the rest of our singers have that same great sound."
1,4,"This is a nice product that is perfect for someone like me, basically a one man band.  Guitar is my primary instrument and I am a decent singer, but not great.  This can help clean up my vocals and is helpful if you occasionally stray off key (a little).  Very simple to operate.  Like most swiss army knives it can do a lot of things pretty well but none of them great. Hvr, considering the price, I think it's excellent.  Would buy it again if stolen (as they say)."
1,5,"I have a small format 10 channel mixer for my acoustic and small gigs and it has no built in effects. It also gets a little bit noisy when using the EQ on the two mic pre channels.The Mic Mechanic allows me to dial in foot switchable effects right on y pedalboard, where they should be for a solo act or when your running your own sound. I typically leave the &#34;Tone&#34; button on at all times, as it gives a nice eq curve and mild compression. Effects are easy dial up on the selector and can be customized by using the modifiers...(read the manual). The correction works pretty well for me, but someone who is a bett vocalist may not need it, in which case, you can turn it down. I typically run mine around 12-1:00E thing I don't like about this pedal is its 12v power consumption. It can be phantom powered, but if I engage phantom power on my mixer it is on for both mic pres And I use the other often times for a second dynamic mic when playing as a duo. It can run off the Sanyo Pedal Power without issue however and I often use it on my acoustic pedalboard with a compressor and delay/reverb for my guitar."
0,2,"When I originally went out to place this order, I was planning to order the  TC Electronics Singles VoiceTone C1 Vocal Effects Processor for its pitch correction function. As I looked over that device and some alternatives, I finally ordered the TC-Helicon Mic Mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects. I ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could TC Electronics put out the &#34;Mic Mechanic&#34; with a pitch correction function that didn't do anything? Well, those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has NO EFFECT! Also, I couldn't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button. I kept the Mic Mechanic because I like the other effects, but I'm very disappointed in the primary reason I bought it!"
1,5,"I purchased this to add basic effects to a small PA based on daisy-chainedPowerwerks PW50 Portable PA Systemheads and got a lot more than I bargained for.The effects are beautifully done. Reverb sounds natural and there is a wide range of choices for both reverb and echo. For the record I keep mine set at Club with the wet/dry knob set to a straight 12 o'clock position. Wet means more of the effect and dry means less.There is a mic gain on the left side of the unit, and the mic input (XLR only) has phantom power. The XLR out goes straight to your mixer. There is also a USB port for software I do not use so I cannot speak to that feature.The unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature, which I leave on. It adds a dimension to vocals that does not interfere with them, not does it alter them in ways that are mechanical sounding - you can set it for minor to major pitch correction. I suspect that most folks will want less of this than more.Overall this is a perfect addition to a vocalist's toolbox because it is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive. It's also perfect for adding vocal effects to small, bare-bones PA systems. It transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true PA."
1,5,"This is the best octaver I have ever played through (I bought my first one in 1980), and you would be a dope not to get one now before they become expensive. THREE umm... density/timbral/tonal choices [chorused, only octaved signal, 50/50 mix clean-octaved signal] PER setting, which ranges from -2 to +2 octaves. Quiet and tiny footprint. You'd be dumb not to get one while they're cheap."
1,5,"Depends on what your looking for. Is this a POG...nope, but it has some tricks up it's leave for the price. The only con I can give is when playing chords when dropping down (like a drop D) it doesn't always sound grant. Bar chords work a little better"
1,4,"I have owned almost every octave/harmonizer/pitch shifter on the market. For what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of, you cant beat it. First off, Its polyphonic. You wont find that in anything else under $300. Instant tracking, wide range of versatility, perfect volume balancing and very solid design. Only two flaws: a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals, still doesnt hum as bad as my POG did. The only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode. Its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day. Otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam. Great job Mooer, i cant wait to try more of your stuff."
0,1,"If you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static, non-oscillating, chorus like effect, it's fine for that.  As an actual pitch shifter though, this thing is awful.  All the pitch shift settings sound like they're 30 cents sharp. This is especially awful sounding when used as an Octave effect.  I suppose I could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but I did not want to void the warranty so I just returned it.  It's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is.  I've read the same complaint about their Pure Octave pedal also. This is really too bad because all the other pedals for Mooer seem to be quite good.  I own their Reecho Delay pedal and quite like it and I'm also tempted to get their Green Mile pedal.If you're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies, this pedal maybe fine for you but I doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.One minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals.  It does not stick to the adhesive on ANY of the Velcro strips I've tried to use."
1,4,"The Mooer Pitch Box in the harmonist mode blends the dry signal with the altered pitch, and in the pitch shift mode if filters out the dry signal.The pitch knob allows you to raise the note 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 24 semitones, or lower the note by 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 24 semitones.I found that putting a distortion pedal in front of the Pitch Box made the harmonies more pronounced. Making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable. And in general it helps it sounds more like a guitar and less like an organ.When I had the pitch box in front of the distortion pedal, it had this constant warble that sounded like an out of tune guitar. The detune mode sounds like a chorus but I almost never use it."
1,5,"Works well and has some nice features for extra tuning help. Comparing it to my old BOSS TU-12 dedicated guitar tuner, this works just as good."
1,5,"I chose a 5 star rating, because i've simply never owned a tuner of this high quality in my lifetime. This tuner blows away my old 'Guitar Professor-Qwik Tune' Tuner. This tuner gives unbeatable performance therefore the price is justified in my opinion."
1,5,"I ordered TM50BK unit but after a couple of delays with my local delivery agent, decided to buy a unit locally which turned out to be the Korg Beat Boy.The Beat Boy is everything that this unit is and then some. In addition to the metronome and tuner, it has a record function and drum tracks, in all 100 different patterns. The units have an almost identical front panel with the metronome patterns in with the drum options, the extra buttons for the record and an external mic for acoustic instruments.Had I seen the Beat Boy first, I would have ordered it instead as I was looking for a drum machine anyway. The functions which are shared between the 2 units work really well, the tuner is accurate and fast, and can't fault the metronome.I will probably keep the TM50BK as a spare, but I'm also glad my local shippers have prolonged the wait. If you just want a metronome and tuner, this is a fine unit, but if you're considering a drum machine too, look at the Beat Boy before making any decisions."
1,5,"I started to play the violin a few months ago.  When I got my violin, I purchased the Korg CA1 Chromatic Tuner thinking I would not need a metronome.  The Korg CA1 also cost slight less.  However, now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome.  She has the Korg TM40 metronome.  I opted to purchase the newer model Korg TM50PW Instrument Tuner and Metronome.  It is great.  Based on my experience, unless you are sure you do not need a metronome, I would recommend everyone purchased the TM40 or TM50 (just in case) instead of the CA1."
1,5,"I play using this device. It is portable, so I always have it with me. I tune the A to 432, and this works well for that. Has a tuner and a metronome. What's not to love. Best to carry a cable to plug into the guitar, unless you are in a quiet area. It is sensitive, and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings. This is a good thing: it's sensitive."
1,4,"So ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now. Ive ran different setups and seem to work well with my pedals one at a time except for one issue that I noticed consistently, so beware of this.One channel (#8) does 9v with 500mA, sounds great right?I plug in my Even Tide Timefactor and works great by itself. Once I added other pedals, there became a horrible hum. Like noticable and just horrible. Then I used my stock Timefactor power supply and plugged in my entire rig without drawing 500mA from output 8, and there was no hum.This phenomena also occured when I plugged in my Holy Grail pedal (the classic one) that draws 500mA as well.kind of annoying to have a power strip to power all my pedal, but im not complaining about it for a power supply that is a fraction of the price of a vodoo pp2+, to power most of my pedal quietler than a one spot."
1,4,"This isn't the best power supply available. It doesn't truly isolate each input. The description says the outputs are &#34;isolated,&#34; but what this means is that they are independent; that is, if one input has a short in it, that one will cease to function and not the other, working inputs. So the short circuit protection is isolated, but the grounding is not.This can cause some issues with noise, but there are other things that can cause noise too. It's not always just the power supply making the noise. It could be certain pedals, cables, or some combination of factors. A power conditioner will sometimes help as well.However, the Joyo provides plenty of power--enough for 8-9V inputs and 1 each of 12V and 18V.It is dependable, solidly built, comes with plenty of connectors and is small enough to fit on moderately sized pedal boards. I have 12 5 x 3 pedals on my board with 2 of these Joyo units, and my board is about 26 x 14.There is some noise, but I don't attribute that just to the power supply. It takes some investigating and maybe an experienced tech to trace this down. I'm not sure it can ever be completely eliminated, but the Joyo itself seems to produce very little, and it's a third to half the price of the truly isolated units, and a definite step up from a daisy chain. It also has those cool blue lights that you can turn on or off."
1,5,"Very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others.  This is not true isolated outputs, but it is quiet and that is what counts.  I have the Fuel Tank Chameleon and I end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best, mainly because of the 500ma output. Here is a comparison of the JP-02, Chameleon, and the OneSpot.  I have all three.T-REX FUEL TANK CHAMELEON (1350ma)Outputs 1-3: 9v/12v 300maOutput 4: 9v/18V 150maOutput 5: 9v/12v 300ma| ---- Use 5 OR 6 only, not bothOutput 6: 12v AC 300maJOYO SP-02 (1000ma)Outputs 1-7: 9v 100maOutput 8: DC 9V Maximum output of 500mAOutput 9: DC12V 100maOutput 10: DC18V 100maVISUAL SOUND ONESPOT (1700ma 9v only)Daisy Chain Power into 8 pedals not exceeding 1700ma"
1,4,"This thing Rocks! Unlike other cheap Chinese-made ripoffs (ahem... Behringer) These Joyo products are well made, inexpensive and worth every penny."
1,5,"I have a home brew pedal board with 6 pedals on it. This allowed me to clean up the wiring a lot and powers all of them with no problems. The blue LED lights are quite bright and make the pedals visible in dark room conditions. Not a bad price, either!"
1,4,"I like this power supply, but I wish that the LED's only turned on for the channels that you have a cable plugged in to, so for that reason I'll give it 4 stars as opposed to 5. The quantity of power outlets and the amperage's that it provides are best in class."
1,5,"So far this power supply is great! Pretty compact and light, come with all the power cables you need and does the job at a far more reasonable price at the other power supplies I was considering. No complaints here!"
1,4,"Well, it's a solid chunk of metal.  The lights on it are either all on or all, off, so they are useless to me.You can power any lightweight 9v, 12, or 18v stompbox with this.  Just watch the milliamps because I don't think this can deliver much more than a few hundred per box.My only issue with it is that the included patch cords are all the same length.  Would have been nice to have a few really long ones.It is more expensive than a one spot, but I guess this is a neater solution and at the very least, I can actually use my all the stompboxes  I want now."
1,5,joyo makes great quality products  cheap. I love this product it works great. all my pedals hove there own power supply
1,4,"I've read its not really complete isolated, but it does the job. I didn't realise how much noise my one spot was adding. I A/B them both one after the other and it truly was quieter. the only Problem I have is my TC Helicon takes 12 volts input but 300MA. this pedal only supplies 100MA so the pedal didn't work in the 12 volt slit. Luckily however it does work plugged into the 9volt 300MA spot so im using it there. everything else in the other 9volt 100MA slots.it's a lot quieter now. I recommend trying it and saving some cash."
1,5,"I admit I haven't had it long, but so far so good. I have a Gator pedal board that came with their power supply. Unfortunately, that thing has a proprietary connector on the cable. The PS is fine, but the cable is shorting out. Couldn't find another cable, so I thought I'd find another solution with a more generic cable. This Joyo product fits that and is cheaper than the competition (which made me a little skeptical). I may never need all its features, but for what I need (powering 5 devices) it is doing the job beautifully. My pedal board includes tuner, chorus and octaver stomp boxes, a bass DI and a Rolls headphone amp. The JP-02 frees me up from any other wall warts. Money! Now I just need to figure a way to attach it to the bottom of the pedal board."
1,5,"Ordered a set of these to put 2 on my Ibanez and 2 on my Squier, they fit perfectly. Highly recommended."
1,4,"If you are ordering these to replace one or two of your Gibson Speed knobs, you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to Gibson's.In all fairness, these could possibly be BETTER than Gibson's stock, seem to be made with a more solid underside, but the numbers are a little bit smaller.This is the only reason I gave them four stars.Fit perfectly on CTS potentiometers and if you replace all four of them, nobody except you will know! -lol.All four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects, as opposed to other reviews.If you get these and they aren't perfect...send them back until you get a perfect set! It's free!Hope this helps...not much else to say!"
1,5,"Not much you can say about these, they're knobs! They fit perfectly and are of high quality finish. They finish off my bass nicely as I like to have the numerals there for reference."
1,5,"Not much to say here - they're knobs. They look good, are well made and fit perfectly on the CTS pots in my guitar."
1,4,What can I say?  They look great and were cheap.  My kind of product.  Bought them to replace the old &#34;vintage&#34; style knobs on my LP clone.  Much nicer looking!
1,5,I have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work. Focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this. I have only made a few recording but I am going to make a lot more. Very easy to use.
1,5,"I wanted to find a device that let me record easily when at a gig, or just in my office. I did a LOT of research into devices that were USB only, even other ones that Focusrite sold. The main reason I picked this one was its versatility in being both iPad and USB compatible.The complaints about the iPad connector cable are valid - it's too stiff and short. I feel like I might accidently break it off if I'm not too careful. Why it uses a proprietary connector on the back of the unit, I'll never know. To combat the included 30-pin cable I bought a$10 3ft 30-pin extension cable, which seems to do the job nicely. The GarageBand software on the iPad is simple enough to use, and while it can only record one of the 2 input channels at a time, that's fine for what I expected. To record from a live sound-board, I just use the XLR input, set the gain (with the awesome colored halo ring), and save the recording as a mono track.Being small and solidly built, I've got no problem tossing this in the milk-crate with the rest of my cables and peddles.In regards to how it records when plugging into a computer via USB (an iMac in this case), it's even better than I expected. The GarageBand software on the Mac does have the ability to record both input channels at the time time. The on-board monitor volume and headphone is fantastic. I thought it only would play back what was being input at that moment, but it does more than that. It's a real monitor (the GarageBand software recognizes it's the monitor output), and when you have a multi-track recording that you're working on, the software allows you to pass back other tracks from the computer while recording a new track.For example, I recorded a track with just the guitar (track 1), I was using the 1/4"" input channel, and laid down that track. Then I created a second guitar track and recorded a second guitar part (headphones plugged into iTrack Solo) and I was able to hear both the current track I was recording, and the first track. Lastly, I plugged in a mic into the first input, and created a 3rd vocal only track. When I was singing, I was able to hear both guitar parts with the headphones still plugged into the iTrack Solo as well as my vocals recording in real-time. I wasn't expecting this level of capability, and was very impressed by the lack of any noticeable latency in both the backing tracks and the vocals I was recording with all 3 going at the same time.The last thing I want to mention is the XLR pre-amp. Focusrite has been making high-end professional recording equipment for a long time, and the thing they're most well-known for is the mic pre-amp. I have to say, it is spectacular. There is absolutely no noise (no hiss, or clicks) of any kind. The gain staging nobs with the color halos make it so easy to setup, it's almost too easy. The sound it captures is exactly what you expect, and you'll notice right away if you're using a low quality microphone. It definitely stands up to their reputation. Having 48v phantom power to use those top dollar condenser mics is also a really nice thing to have. The demos on their website show how simple it is to use. Once you start playing with it, you'll realize it is a really nice tool for a solo artist, or someone who wants high portability, but great sound quality."
1,5,"Despite its iFlavor it works beautifully with my PC. Sounds better than any sound card i've used and of course gives me the ability to play and record on my computer with no noticeable latency. It's a great intro model, not just for ipads. Whole device is powered and runs over one USB cord. I'm so impressed, my main PC audio comes out of the headphone jack of this device. It's an extremely capable machine with good drivers and works great with REAPER."
1,4,"I bought one of these for myself after using one in a junior high school music program. (I'm a teacher, not a student.) I have only used it with Garage Band, but it works really well. I have used it to record electronic drums, bass guitar (direct out from a multi-effects pedal), vocals, and guitar (with garage band's virtual amps.) I've been very impressed. If you really turn up the gain, you will start to get a lot of noise, but the noise comes well AFTER you get past the point that any reasonable signal is &#34;clipping&#34;-making the light turn red. So, with the gain at 1/3 or so of the way up, you get good clean signal with little to no noise. The cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short. I bought 2 of the same Ziotek extension cable-at the recommendation of Focusrite. One worked, the other didn't. So, yeah, best of luck with that. Focusrite should really have made a longer cable. It gets in the way of the USB power plug a little bit, and makes things awkward. Other than that, I like it a lot."
0,1,"I got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue:  when I record a track either with the ""Audio Recorder"" or ""Guitar Amp"" screens in Garageband on my iPad 3, iOS7, the recording is great. But once I toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made, there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable.  Here's the other part of this: I can use Apogee Jam guitar interface, and iRig Pre microphone interface and Garageband behaves as it should and I can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever. The Focusrite support folks suggested I do a backup of my iPad contents and then do a software restore but I opted to return the unit instead, since the Apogee and iRig both work perfectly with Garageband. So, I don't know if the unit is having a problem with iOS7 or I just happened to get a lemon but I'll find out when the new one comes next week.  If it works correctly, I'll update this review after doing a few recordings. But, I would say if you've just updated to iOS7 or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit, you might want to hold off on that upgrade.  UPDATE: Got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my iPad, as suggested by a Focusrite support tech, and STILL have the problem I discussed above.  So, this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me. If anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution,  please let me know."
1,5,This music package by Led Zepplin is historical and put together well. Great for any Zep fan. Great audio and video. I especially liked the unreleased version of For Your Life!
1,5,"What else can be said that isn't implied in the title of this review? Not a single second wasted in this performance and this bundle is perfect for those of us who don't want to purchase the items separately. My only issue was how long this took to come out considering the show was 5 years ago. That and the fact they didn't play more songs but who can blame them, their catalog is  almost endless (one of the few bands who matched quantity with quality)."
1,5,Get this. It was awesome! Blu-Ray surround with the band was just amazing. Great extras too. They were so much tighter on this concert than back in &#34;How the West was Won&#34;
1,5,"I was a little nervous for some reason when I started watching this (I saw it in the theatre).  I was afraid I might be in for another Live Aid let down or something like that.  I had heard the epic reviews and the internet buzz when the actual event happened...but had no idea if this would be as good as all that.  Never fear, you need to see this film.  The guys prove that the hype was legit.  I was so stoked when they launched in to some of my faves like ""For Your Life"" even if the performances of ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Stairway"" seemed a little pedestrian.  But hey, it's LZ doing Stairway which is better than 99% of the music on the planet so who cares if it was an obligatory performance?  The show seems to get better as it goes along, and by the time ""Kashmir"" comes on I had tears in my eyes.  No joke.  This show is riveting.  I bought the Blu-Ray so I could continue to experience the awesomeness of this show, which really defies description.  I am not sure if non-LZ fans can appreciate how incredible this show is, or what the band accomplished in doing this.  They took it seriously and rehearsed for 7 weeks for this one event.  Jason Bonham did a good job of honoring his father and staying true to the original material and live nuances developed over multiple tours in the 70's.  If you love LZ you probably already have this set, if you have a passing interest only you will witness a one-night-only reunion that blows away any of the other weak attempts by older bands of this era.  It's pretty awesome."
1,5,"I love the performances and sound production quality of Celebration Day! The band's on fire and Jason Bonham did a incredible job. A must buy for the Zep fan I can highly recommend this.To rehearse that long for this one show it's a shame they could not consider another world tour or at least a few more concerts. With Jason doing so well it was possible I could easily imagine NY, SF, Rio, Paris, Rom, Tokyo etc"
1,5,"The Flashback x4 is an awesome sounding and flexible Delay pedal. I got this through a third party seller on Amazon for under $200 new... a steal in my opinion. Having three settings is awesome since I will use them all in a set. Having the tap tempo is a must and this one works perfectly. The toneprints are cool to choose from if you find something you enjoy on the website. It's simple to use my Galaxy to &#34;beam&#34; the toneprint into the pedal from the pickups - very cool technology, makes me feel like I'm on a guitar version of star trek. I can't say that I have a favorite delay type since they all sound so great. I am partial to the 2290 with modulation - very clean and very cool sounding without having too much chorus. The space setting is also very cool and has a hint of tremelo in the background, which coincides with the delay time - sounds great with a little overdrive added in.All in all, this is a great pedal and a purchase that I am totally happy with. It is by far the best delay pedal I have ever owned as well as being the most versatile. Five Stars from me!!!"
0,3,"First of all its huge... no., like really huge....But finally you get over that, but seriously, its huge.The three presets are what sets this apart, but this could have been so very much better... why?.the midi clock sync implementation is flawed..A. The midi clock sync of delay operation is erratic and largely unreliable, particularly if you wish to change presets during a song or turn them on/off.B. To have a midi in, and not be able to midi sync/quantize the looper.. sigh...like really?.. This means you cant play with a drum machine, sampler, sequencer or play with anyone that does!So, while this offers some functionality above the Flashback in that this unit gives three preset delays (only one of which can be used at a time) and can be used as a basic looper (along with the delay defined by the knobs), The downside is a very large footprint.Therefore:BUY if you have the space and either need the three presets, or have neither a looper OR a delay.CONSIDER PASSING if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision... both are weak, after the fact, implementations"
1,5,"This is far more pedal than I need but what a fun pedal to have.  Just going through the presets was fun, but downloading and trying the stuff they have available online was even funner :)  The bad part about this pedal is that it is HUGE and will take up a lot of space on your board.  You have to be committed to dealy.  You'll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches.  I can't comment on the looper as I never used it."
1,5,"You can set up 3 delays configurations, what is a interesting option to use on stage. Tap function also helps a lot. All type of delays are sounds beatiful..."
0,2,No manual.  You can print one off the internet but it should come with one given it's price.  I purchase such so I could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live.  Don't believe this is what it is mean't for.  A simple delay looper will suffice.  This can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs.
1,5,"Don't know why quality instruments don't come with bone nuts but these are a very inexpensive improvement.  The next time you change your strings, check and see if your current nut is plastic.  If so, have a few of these on hand and re[place that nut.  You will hear the difference and they don't wear out like plastic.Just make certain you get the height correct so your action isn't too high.  Rule of thumb, grind just a bit at a time and keep checking for correct height.  You can always remove more material but you can't put it back on...This is a quick, easy improvement.  I have bone on all of my guitars."
1,5,"I liked the string spacing on these nuts. You ~could~ just drop it in and play but you will soon realize it will need some refinement. My open B and E strings, with somewhat aggressive picking, would buzz like a sitar. This was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners. Some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges. The base of this bone nut does NOT have a radius. So if your nut slot is radiused, you will need to have it done or you will have poor sustain and possibly crack the nut in half at string tension. This is more common in vintage guitars, though.My guitar's sustain was definitely improved with this nut. I highly recommend it!"
1,4,"With a little sanding, this fit my Fender American Strat perfectly. Great sound that only a bone nut can produce. My strings stay in tune even better with this installed. Very nice value!"
1,5,"I've just replaced the original, plastic nut on my new Squier Strat guitar with this one.I had to file it down slightly to fit the slot and set the string height that I wanted but this was simple to do using a single flat metal nail file.I was shocked at how much 'brighter' the guitar sounded with only this single change!Even my wife who claims to have a tin ear, commented on how much clearer it now sounds.Also, the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated. My piece arrived in a week (thank you very much!).For the low price, I think this will improve the sound of your guitar (safely) more than any other upgrade."
0,2,"For the price I can hardly complain, but unfortunately the item was not the correct size for a Fender Strat replacement. Checked it Against my American Standard, MIM Strat and Squier and it would not fit any of them. Should have just used one of my dog's chew bones and cut it myself, would have been more accurate."
1,5,"This will last a very long time due its sturdy construction. Two pieces, easy to set up in seconds. Great buy for the $. (...ONLY MINE WAS A 'HAMILTON')"
1,5,"Far better than any light weight chrome stand, this has guts!  Easily adjustible, knobs tighten easily and firmly.  Good height adjustment for sitting or standing.  Highly reccomend this stand!"
1,5,This is a really nice music stand. I wasn't expecting it to be such high quality. I wanted something better than those cheap metal music stands that would get knocked over by a small breeze of wind. Definitely got what I wanted. The orange Gearlux logo looks pretty cool too. Buy it.
1,5,"I needed a new stand for my home studio so I thought I was cutting corners when I purchased this one. As it turns out, this stand is practically indistinguishable from myBelmonte Orchestra Stand Deluxein construction and material quality. That stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this review.The stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians, and is stable enough to use outside. The rest/tray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments. In fact, I have attached anAleratec Universal Tablet Mountto hold an iPad with sufficient room left over for a 438 page copy of theThe New Real Book - Volume 1and it holds those rock steady.Another feature that I like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles, which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands. Or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stand's footprint are not problems.Bottom line: this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price. I am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever I need another stand this is the model I will purchase."
1,5,"Super sturdy, well built. What more can I say, it's a sheet stand."
1,5,"This is a great stand and highly adjustable. Can be used seated or standing for a person over 6 feet tall. There was a review I read with negative comments about the design, claiming that pulling on the panel to lift the stand would cause it to come off. Nonsense. There are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rock-solid. Because it's lightweight and portable, I could see it getting top heavy if you put a heavy book on the stand and jacked it up to maximum height. But this is a GREAT stand."
1,5,"solid good stand, it is decent quality and doesn't have any places that will break easily.  can take anywhere you want"
1,5,"I wasn't expecting much from this case; I bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that I had also order off Amazon that was of better quality then I had expected. This case is sweet! I love the black and crome, it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth. If you need a case don't even think twice about, this is a great one at a great price."
1,4,"For the money, this is a great guitar case.  I bought it for a Silvertone SD10, which costs about $120.  The guitar fits it fine.  I use it to store my guitar around the house or put it in the back of the car to transport it.  I don't think I would take it on an airline.  They destroy luggage, so I don't think it would fair well.  The compartment inside is large enough for picks, strings, capo and a strap with room to spare.  Mine opens and closes ok and the lock works. It is well worth the $60 I paid for it."
1,4,"it is a hardshell case, about what I expected, decent low end hardshell but serviceable. I wouldn't check in with an airline, I can lean on the top and push it in. for a little extra protection over a gig bag YES, don't put an amp on top of it in a van though."
1,5,"Looked at a lot of cases most priced $90 or above.  Settled on this one because of price, reviews, and measurements posted here in the reviews that assured my my guitar would fit.  I have an Alvarez AD60 (dreadnaught style body) and it fits in this case nice and snug.  Solid, well padded, sturdy latches, and everything lines up.  Very happy with my purchase."
1,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for the protect my investment.  I tried purchasing a soft case that had the Seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar, it didn't.  It was way too short for my Seagull S-12 Coastline.  This is a sturdy case that looks good too."
1,5,Bought these as an extra set just in case I made a mistake when I was trying to cut down my nut and bridge. They are real bone and fit well on my Yamaha. Did not end up using them but will one day. Great product for the price.
1,5,This is real bone.  The length is perfect for my guitar but the nut is a little high and the bridge saddle is thicker than the slot on my guitar. It is just my luck that I have some sandpaper in my garage so I sanded each bone and was able to install this new parts on my guitar after about 10 minutes of sanding.
1,5,"After reading many review on my Yamaha 700 acoustic guitar I have owned and played for 4 months, I finally took the advice of other consumers.  MANY people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone.This guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was.  I did put a light set of D'addario strings that made a world of difference.I was due for another string change so upgraded with this set of bone nut and saddle.WOW, it really did make a huge difference.  This guitar is such a quality piece, especially for the money.  But, with the string and bone upgrades I can't imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic.  It changed the tone to that of a classical  guitar.  I am so happy with my changes.The high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep.  The sustain is a drastic improvement, each note lasting nicely into the next.  I am so pleased and excited with my guitar.If you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle.....change them, it's a very quick fix.  And find a nice set of strings."
1,5,"The saddle, after some minor rounding at the edges, fit perfectly as a replacement for the one that came with my Takamine acoustic. I haven't replaced the nut yet, but even so the improvement in tone and sustain is quite noticeable. These are high quality parts, well worth the relatively small investment.Edit: I have since replaced the nut too, and am pleased to report it is a near perfect fit, though it is a tiny bit shorter across than the old one. But the difference is negligible, and the improvement in tone and action was well worth the small additional expenditure of time and effort."
1,5,"for the price of 1 ( one) saddle at GCyou get 2 of these and the nut assembliesi keep them handy for guitar setup changesordered on Monday, arrived on thursday"
1,5,"[Now that the SN-13 is about the same price as an SN-8, I've changed the comment about the price differential.]The SN-13 is another great Snark chromatic tuner with a Super Tight display. However, the black SN-8 adds a tap tempo metronome and the ability to set the tuner a few semi-tones below standard for about the same price.  (No matter for me since all I use is the tuner, anyway.)  Still, the SN-13 is *white* and, for all I know, may do a better job at tuning an older iPad.  :-)"
1,5,"Cheap, Easy, Durable, these things are worth the small price. I have one for each guitar and just leave them on!"
1,5,"I love the Snark tuners, and I own several different models.  They all work great and of the various models, I prefer the SN-2 (red).  I got the white one because I just liked that it was a unique, Amazon-only model.  The SN-13 display is like the display on the SN-8, and offers lower resolution than the SN-1/SN-2/SN-5 displays.  Still it works beautifully, and the glossy white looks nice clipped on my Pearl White APX700.  Its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark."
1,5,"Well, without a tuner like this someone playing woodwinds might not even realize how a number of notes, usually in the lower octaves, are a little off.  With cheaper made instruments like school instruments you would be surprised.  This tuner helps you not only start in tune but also develop some strategies to deal with those sour notes.  The fact that it works on guitars also just makes it worth the extra few dollars.  Highly recommended.  And it looks great too."
1,4,"I'll be honest here - I bought this one primarily because of its looks.  Not a lot of white clip-on tuners around. I also own an SN-8 and in comparing the two, the SN-13 seems to be as tight, but it's only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the SN-8 (which has more features) for a few dollars less than what you're paying for the SN-13.  Still, it's a typical Snark.  It registers very quickly, it's easy to read, and you don't have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration. The stem on mine is a little looser than I would prefer but it still stays in position.My only real gripe isn't unique to this model but to all Snarks.  The curved stem combined with the round head means it won't sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems aren't exactly robust, so I'm always concerned that one day I'm going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces.  Other than that, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner."
1,5,"I have several of these tuners and this one is as great as all the others. Easy and quick. No reason to be out of tune with these tuners. The white is great but no matter what color they are, they are a quality product. Rock on...."
1,5,"There are lots of ways to tune a guitar ranging from using a tuning fork to sitting next to a properly tuned piano. I've also used a variety of electronic tuners over the years with everything from rows of flashing lights to meters with a needle. There are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators, metronomes, etc. built in. But this device is simple, portable, easy to use, and just plain works. It's also cheap enough that even if you have other types of tuners, it's worth the money to get one of these for each guitar case. Aside from its simplicity, it's also less bothered by background noise, as other units with microphones might be."
1,5,I set this to free super saver shipping 5-8 days and it got here in three! Its very shiny looking and easy to see because there is a little thing where you can move to point the screen of it. Although my friend told me there is a way you can see the chords you are playing don't know how though. But all I bought it for was the purpose of tuning Mission accomplished. 5 stars for you!
1,5,"If you're going to use this as an insert effect into any amp, the first thing you need to do is turn off the amp model.Although I liked the presets in the MS50G, none of them worked in my rig. The first thing that I did when I brought it home was to make a different single patch for each effect. The big question is &#34;Why?&#34; especially since it's designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously. The answer is... I like my overdrive, distortion, and compressor, but I couldn't make up my mind on delays, choruses, flangers, fuzz... and it's always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortions.This is the 4th pedal on my board sitting behind a ModTone Lemon Squeeze Compressor, TC Electronics MOJOMOJO overdrive, and a Wampler Sovereign distortion.I give it 5 stars because it accepts pedals well and it serves so many different needs. Normally, I have it set as just a chorus pedal, but occasionally I use it as an additional overdrive or distortion. It's great to be able to plug in whatever I need and know that the sound quality is going to be great!It takes a moment to level match each patch so the transition is smooth, and at some point I may take the few remaining slots and make them combinations, but as of yet, I really haven't had the need... a great utility pedal and a must if you're just getting started on your pedal board and you're not sure of what pedal you want where. This will help you figure things out... and if you're not careful, it may find a permanent home!"
1,5,"It does take a little getting used to the programming aspect, but this little pedal is amazing.  I must have 20 different pedals, and I'm always torn which ones ones to bring to practice. With this pedal, it's easy...just grab and go.  Are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals?  Probably not.  But they do the job just fine.  The thing I love the most, and this may be a little anal, but I've actually preset individual settings for each song I play with my band.  That way I can shuffle through the presets with one stomp. Some have two pedal effects, some have 6! If this broke or wore out for whatever reason, I would go right out and buy another one for sure.  Best $100 I've spent on gear."
1,5,"This is an extremely versatile pedal.  I was considering getting a reverb or delay pedal, but I decided to go with this instead since it's infinitely more flexible.There are tons of effects.  Some I might not use, but there are plenty I will use.  New firmware was just released, and it adds a few extra effects.  You download the firmware and install via the USB port.I use it with a VHT special 6.  I have a Fulltone OCD after the Zoom.  It works nicely with the tube amp whether or not I turn the OCD on.  The effects sound excellent to me.  I'm now a Zoom fan.If you're lusting after a bunch of effects pedals, but only have the cash for one, this is a really good option.  At a minimum, you'll hopefully figure out the 5-10 you won't really use without having to shell out the cash for them."
1,4,"If you are an electric guitar player, you know how it is ... you think you are finished with your pedal board but in a few weeks you are back at it searching for another effect ... but this means trial and error and a busy wallet ... the solution may be this Zoom MS50G ... this unit is like having 50 stompboxes to use on demand without having to change out your board ... here are some the things I like most about this pedal:1) Small footprint; same size as most single stompboxes of today2) The digital effects are very, very good .... most have an almost analog quality to them3) Ability to create and save your own patches, ordering them for stage use4) Good tuner included; I found it to be very accurate and easy to use (if you already have a tuner, then you can open up another slot!)5) Great price ... considering 50 effects, this thing costs no more than a single stompboxThe unit is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it; however, I will say it takes some work to get a handle on everything and the manual isn't a great deal of help.  But with just a little work and resolve, you'll be dialing in some new sounds.I have been very pleased with the capabilities and the sounds from the MS50G ... Zoom has a reputation of creating quality effects units at very reasonable prices; they've done it again with this pedal ... I highly recommend it if you have one slot on your pedal board but don't know which pedal should fill it ...*one thing to note that was frustrating at first:  most of the OD's and Distortion's are preset with the levels way too high for output to a tube amp ... once you put these pedals in your own patches you can permanently save them with appropriate levels ... just be prepared to cut the levels down right away when trying out OD's and Distortions or you will likely get some very unpleasant feedback ..."
1,5,"Im an true analog guy. But when I grabbed this pedal I was blown away. This little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size. A lot of which do not sound to digital. I was amazed at the tones I could pull out of it. For $99- it is a steal. I would pay twice that for what this pedal does. Easy to navigate and understand. Small enough to fit on any pedalboard. Easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches. If you're looking for a multi effects stomp box, look no farther than the Zoom MS-50G. Well worth the $99.00. Can easily set it up for live situations. Of course you're not gonna get all the effects at a drop of a dime. But I set mine up for a few effects I use live. Works flawless. When in the studio, this is where the pedal shines. Also it can't be beat for when you're just jamming alone at home. If you're are gigging, of course this isn't going to be your go to pedal, but it does come in handy for some really nice effects. The review before mine, well they should of known this pedal isn't the greatest for live venues. That's why we have pedalboards with all our different effects we can call up with the drop of a foot. I was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so. Went to a local music store, heard and was sold. No one can touch Amazon's price and service. Get off the fence and buy this pedal. I promise you won't be sorry \m/CONS: No power supply or USB cable. Besides that, the pedal is a bargain and sounds fantastic!"
0,1,"I have been using this gig bag for the past few months. If I do the math, I probably didn't use it more than 10 times, basically from home to the subway, from the subway to the studio and back, so maybe 20 minutes walk each time. So I used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes, mostly carrying it on my shoulders, sometimes by one of the two handles.Then the side handle started coming apart: the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used. It will be OK for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking (which I kind of expect at this point!). Meanwhile I'm going to buy another (sturdier) gig bag.Save your money and get something better than this."
1,4,"Honest for cost it's 5 star, but I got 2, and 1 handle was slightly mismolded, rubber groove is a little off... But in no way matters.  Just kinda ok really now I can tell them apart by feel.This is a nice heavy Cordura (like military spec heavy) with self repairing zippers (standard kind) and totally adequate pad, soft nylon lined, and bonus pockets... 3.  Nice build, PVC piping on pocket edges, adequate pad backpack straps for any acoustic weight.  Heavy rubber feet for standing it up, give a 1/2"" of  wet ground protection if needed.For the price of 1 many other brands, I got 2,And for what most folks expect they are great."
0,1,This thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked. What can you expect for $20 tho. This was a temporary solution I don't recommend this for long term use it will probably fall apart.
0,3,For my first gig bag its ok. I since then bought a new alvarez acoustic electric which i will be buying a hard case simply because the build quality and protection isnt there in a padded case. I have had this padded bag for a year now with light use and edges are starting to tare and rip. Also i am concerned that the zippers might get stuck and break at any moment. I will be replacing this with a hard cases as soon as i buy one for my alvarez.
1,5,"Just got three of these in today and compared one to a used Fender standard (one strap) bag I also got in at the same time.The Chromacast has thicker padding that is covered with cloth on the inside while the Fender does not go thisextra step. The Chromacast also has many more pockets.The specs on the Fender and Chromacast do not back up reality, as the Fender advertizes 12mm padding, and the Chromacast advertizes 10mm padding. Someone is not telling the truth here, and I think it is Fender.This is a good medium class gig bag, that falls somewhere in between a dust bag (like the Burswood) and a Deluxe 20-22mm padded bag.The only thing the bag is missing, is a hanger on the back which the Fender does have.Chromacast should get rid of the plastic (expensive) hand grip on the front of the bag and just sew on a hanger on the back like everyone else.This bag is good for in house, and light use (no throwing it around) transport.If you are gigging, use a deluxe bag, or a hard case.At $20.00, this bag is a steal!"
1,4,"I had never heard of ChromaCast, but after buying this guitar bag, it's easy to understand why this bag is a top seller at Amazon.  It's relatively inexpensive, fairly well built, and features a number of zippered compartments of varying configurations, to store accessories.  The case is very convenient to carry, as it has a handle on the top, and a second handle on the side.  It also has a set of shoulder straps, for carrying the guitar on your back.  The quality of the nylon is decent enough, and there is a rubber pad on the bottom for protection and traction.  The amount of padding inside the bag is a little light, and the zippers might not be heavy duty, but for general use, this bag is hard to beat for value.Some have reported that the case is too small to accommodate an acoustic guitar, but I was able to insert my 4.8"" high acoustic inside, with some room to spare.  I was so impressed by the quality of this bag, that I also boughtChromaCast's electric guitar bag, for just $17."
1,5,I recently won an Epiphone les paul specail and was in the market for a bag. This fits nicely and even offers a bit of protection. While I wouldn't say to drop it off the roof or run over it with your car... It does seem to do a nice job of protecting it from bumps on the road and such.
1,5,i own two of these...the first did not have a compartment door..so things just roll around inside case..not happy...but this one is just fine.looks great...no i would not take it on tour...but as far as run around and taking lessons..its safe all latches match up well...enjoy will order again
0,1,Manufacturer's website claimed that this case would fit a Les Paul style guitar. I have an ESP Eclipse. Not even close. ChromaCast products are great. They need to fix the info on their web page. I'm not a fan of shaped Les Paul cases. Too bad.
1,5,"The quality of it is above my expectations. The only thing I would've like different is the accessory box inside. They could've make it a little bigger. The box already fell down 4 times (I got small kids...) and nothing happened to it or the guitar. Great product, worth every penny."
1,5,it is more than I hoped for! Very nice protection for my Luna! it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat!
1,5,Once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery.have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon. All latch well and look good. Do not fly my guitars anywhere but do carry them in my truck over the road and no damage even with falls along the way.have five hard cases of various brands and all bought thru amazon wirh no complaints with any of them. All fit and work as expected
1,4,"this case is perfect for storing a guitar in, I would not recommend using it for traveling anywhere unless in the back of your own vehicle, it will protect your guitar but it is not a heavy duty case, for the price this would be hard to beat by anyone"
1,5,"I don't travel often with my guitars, but needed good protection for those times when I do. This product meets all my expectations. My Les Paul and Fat Strat, both fit well in the case. It provides good support and cushioning, with a roomy accessories compartment. The corners of the case are well reinforced. The hardware is mid-grade. I believe it will hold up well for my use, and for someone playing weekend gigs. Overall it is a bargain for the price."
0,3,"A good solid case. As for size, it's designed for the narrower Fender style body electric guitars. It could have better padding for instrument protection, ( compared to similar product from other makes.) Will do the job of good protection."
1,5,"This electric guitar padded bag is exactly what I wanted.  The price was right, the guitar is secure and wont' get scratched.  The pockets are deep enough to hold whatever you need for a gig.  Very cost-effective.  Great price."
1,5,"I couldn't be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on Amazon. This was a newly listed item on Amazon when I bought it, (in fact this review will be the first), so I was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback, but I'm glad I decided on this item.I wanted something with several storage compartments, so I could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly. This bag has six separate compartments for storage - three main zipped compartments, each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items. Perfect! I also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled, as well as a guitar strap that I don't currently require as I already have one, but it's nice to have a spare now.The padding of the bag is quite thin, but firm, so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying. The two built in ""back-pack"" straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage, and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes to.If you are in the market for a guitar bag and don't want to spend a fortune, I would definitely recommend you consider this item. It is perfect for my requirements, and may well be for yours too."
1,4,Strap is pretty crappy but picks are nice to have around.  Fairly good quality bag and the pockets are nice.  Good price.
0,3,"This does the job but it's fairly thin and not all that well padded.  For twice the price, you can get a really nice Yamaha hard case that is way more than twice as good.  The strap that came with it is no great shakes either."
1,4,Fits nice and provides good protection.
1,5,"Great gig bag for acoustic guitar. Very well made with good padding. It has six nice pockets, a rubber bumper, and two straps. It fits the guitar nicely. I would definately recommend this to anyone with an acoustic guitar that needs a gig bag. The strap and picks were an added bonus. A great value."
0,3,It only cost around $20 so my expectations weren't very high to begin with but right out of the box it had a hole in the stitching and the front pocket was sown on crooked. I don't plan on keeping it long.
0,1,"Returned this item because the zipper was already broken when I received it. Not durable! Spend a few more dollars, it is worth it."
0,1,"A great little package for the price, but unfortunately, the zipper failed the first time I tried zipping it up. I have a standard size acoustic guitar, but be aware, the fit was snug, but not tight."
1,4,"I'm a beginner, so I'm not very picky on the accessories yet. But this was a great package deal for this price. Shipping was free, it arrived in under 1 week from ordering.Pros:padded caselove the ""backpack"" featurehas many pocketsfits my Takamine Jasmine acoustic perfectpicks vary in size and shapestrap was easy to attachCons:strap is made from nylon and feels cheap (which it is, lol)some poor stitching in one area of the case (shoulder strap) exposing the padding, I restitched fairly easily."
0,3,not as much padding as I would like. my old bag had more. other than that I like the pockets and overall design.
1,5,"I also have a keeley 4 knob compressor but I'm preferring the Xotic pedal right now. The compression is more agressive than the keeley but I find it easier to dial in a good sound, especially using the blend knob, I like to retain some dynamics to my sound. The high/mid/low switch is great, I like it on mid or high, really makes the harmonics come out. There is more volume on tap as well, and I can see how it could also be used as a useful clean boost.  The Keeley has a more dynamic and transparent sound but I also find it's noisier than the Xotic. The Xotic is a fraction of the price though and better overall value I think."
1,5,I have had and tried about every compressor out there.  Lastly the old standard Dyna Comp. Only because its cheap but like the rest it sounds like a compressor and clips your tone.  Blah.  This is a very transparent compressor.  I use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric.  Low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 11:00.  It gives wonderful string balance and sustain. At this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds. And it does not wack the bottom out of your tone.  None of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string.  Just balance and sustain.  As close to a rack mount as it gets. The blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues.  From here you can get any type of compression you want or need.  Mine has a white case.
1,5,"It arrived, I plugged it in, already had a battery in it. Both knobs at 12 o'clock, toggle in middle, didn't change the internal switches. BAM!! Guitar sounds alive! No more weak notes, the thin strings sound big now and match the thicker strings in power. No compressor ""pumping"" very minimal noise (compressors by nature are noisy) It just make the guitar sound better, even and stronger. Compressors can be a beast to control and you do have to go on faith that they work with out squashing or clouding your sound. This pedal has been optimized for guitar, you can tell it is high quality. If you play crystal clear you HAVE to have this pedal. Driven, full distortion it adds sustain. Im Sold. Now I may just have to get the SL drive also by xotic. look it up on youtube."
1,5,I had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed!  This compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack.  It never sounds &#34;thumpy&#34; or unnatural - but always musical.  I really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like.
1,5,"Okay, so... it's small, easy to dial in a good sound, very inexpensive, made here in the US, and has a wonderful transparency to it.Add to that the different ways to configure it (by using the internal dip switches), and you have a compressor as flexible as any I've used for guitar at half or less of many cost (which sound, imho, no better).It stacks well with the EP booster and another comp/boost in the chain, too.Whether you want to drive your amp a little harder or just squash your signal, this product is impossible to beat.I totally adore it."
1,5,"It's sturdy, and holds even a heavy mic in any desired position. I'm using it with a Samson Meteor USB mic (which required some adaptation due to the Meteor's short body), which is a heavy cast-metal mic. No stability problems whatsoever."
1,5,This boom has cleaned up my desk quite a bit and is great value for the price/performance ratio. I have an AT 4033 in it and it holds it in place with no problems. Wish I would have known about it sooner.
0,3,"I had been using a full boom mic stand at my studio desk, and since it was off to the side, made it tuff to watch the level meters. This clamp-on boom serves the purpose, but has a hard time holding the weight of my Shure KSM 32 condenser mic. I tuck the goose neck of the pop filter under it, to keep it from sagging. Very affordable, and I found a work around for the weight issue. I wouldn't recommend this if you're doing a lot of recording, but it is sufficient for my home studio."
1,4,"This arm hold the weight of a ATR2100 microphone fine. It stays where you put it and it works as you would expect. The packaging was damaged and it was shipped just in a plastic shipping bag but it works. The shock mount is the same as one of the low end on stage shock mounts. I did have to slightly bend out the lower bit of the frame to allow it to freely move towards and away from me. However it works great. Not too big and gets the job done.Tip, just take something you can wrap a smaller mic in to get it to fit. My ATR2100 is a 2 inch diameter mic and this shockmount is probably meant for around 3 inches. I just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great."
0,1,straight out of the box this product reeked cheap. No directions inside or on the box. I messed with it for about 5 minutes. I would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic. I read the description but it did not say cheap. Live and learn.
0,3,"There's no way to attach the shock mount to it (screws for securing it aren't provided, the holes dont match up, etc...Oh well, I went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk instead.I'll come up with a use for this arm later otherwise I'd have returned it.Will NOT hold a Blue Yeti / Yeti Pro microphone. Just an FYI"
1,5,"These are nickel round wound strings which are on the bright side of the spectrum. Designed to fit the general use guitarist they do the job. You do get a bit of finger noise moving along the string which is normal for this type of wind. Being 10's they are in the middle between the lighter strings which are easier to bend and the heavier strings which are where the tone is. I love the color coding on these which makes it easier to get the right string in the right hole unless of course you are color blind and there is no help for that. They are made in the USA which is bonus points and reason enough to buy them right there, put America to work. Get to picking."
1,5,"I already use the EXL111 as my go-to electric string and tried these as part of the Vine program.  I have to say I really couldn't feel the difference.  From what I can see the only real difference in this balanced set is that the D string gauge is .25, whereas the same string in the EXL111 set is .24.  Since the string construction and plating is the same, I have to assume these will have the same longevity. I guess as long as both are still available (EXL111 being phased out?) i will be selecting solely on price.  Either way you can't go wrong as D'Addario makes a fine product at a reasonable price."
1,5,"At first, I wasn't sure what to expect from these D'Addario ""Balanced Tension"" strings. D'Addario makes some pretty strong claims for these strings, including ""greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings for evenly balanced bending, strumming, fretting, picking, plucking and slapping"".I can't really speak to those claims; all I can tell you is these are darn good strings, sound great, feel great. I recommend them highly."
1,5,"I'm certainly not the musician in the family and honestly know nothing about guitar strings.  I got these for my husband, the aficionado guitar player in the family!  He said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product.  So they come highly recommended from someone who has uttered a swear word or two over inferior strings in the past!  Highly recommended."
1,5,"The D'Addario Balanced Tension strings are a good value, and worth slightly higher price. These are excellent strings, the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar. They are inexpensive and sound great. For somebody that is a casual home musician, coated strings might be a better choice. The difference, somebody that plays a two or three hours every day, will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in. Somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problem.The big question for me, is the Balanced Tension worth a little extra money? It seems like yes they are. The strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better. There isn't a huge difference. The direct comparison string is D'Addario EXL110, (D'Addario EXL110 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Regular Light, 10-46), at roughly $3.50 a set, these are good solid strings at a bargain price. The EXL110BT strings are about $5.00 a set. If I were going through a set of strings every few days, the EXL110's would probably be a better idea. But if a set is going to last a week or two, the savings overall is pretty small, I would use the EXL110BT's.My personal preference is coated strings, I like Elixir strings a lot. The new D'Addario coated strings are fine, but they end up being about the same price as Elixir. I'll stick with what I know well.My 1981 Lucille did love these strings. They worked out just fine.On the packaging, I don't like what D'Addario has done. All the strings are in a single plastic package, I prefer individual paper envelopes. They loop two strings together and I hate that. When I'm stringing my guitar I like to work with one string at a time, and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench. Sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while. They are trying to save packaging, and that is a good thing. But seriously, that little paper wouldn't kill anybody. I also don't care for the color coded rings on the strings. Lucille has an open bridge where I can see those electric colors. It is a small thing, but I don't like it. I prefer that the rings all be brass, one color. Yeah, I'm the only one that sees that problem. If I work one string at a time from an individual envelope, the color coding is not necessary.These are fine strings. They are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend."
1,5,"I am impressed with d'addario's electric strings. Easy to adjust to, very light on my fingers and they're built to last. With a few adjustments to my amp settings, these strings are very dynamic in their tone quality from classic to hard rock styles. Any guitarist who plays electric can enjoy these strings, and they last a long time too."
1,5,"Compared to the nickel wound XL light gauges I buy in the 3-set boxes, the ""balanced tension"" XL set amounts to slightly lighter D and A strings (.025/.026 and .034/.036 respectively, which I can feel, as well as a slightly thicker B string .0135/.013 which, frankly, I can't feel).The XLs are comparable in gauge to Ernie Ball Regular Slinky (yellow). But if you're used to Slinky's, as I was for many years, the nickel wounds feel noticeably coarser to the skin and took awhile to get used to. I love them now for blues, rock or funk, any kind of playing where you want to dig in a bit for tone - although I will say that for slide (especially when recording at relatively low volume) they don't give quite the same glassy-sounding undertone to my ears as steel wounds, something I happen to prefer.I put the XLs on an Squire Strat, which I like to bend strings on and the 5-position switch gives me a nice range of color to compare. Like the regular XLs, I noticed very little ""new string zing"" after giving them a good stretch. When my skin is dry indoors during the winter the nickels can feel rough at first but in warmer humid temps I sweat more and they get as slick as any steel wounds.I think the balanced tension is more a factor when playing chords than single lines and, for me, it's more of feel thing rather than something I hear (That doesn't make it any less significant to me - I've tossed brand new sets of strings and sold perfectly good guitars on the vague basis they didn't quite feel right).To tell the truth, when playing out I prefer an even heavier set than regular lights for tone, but at home when recording or just playing for myself I like the amount of resistance I get from the nickel wound XLs versus the Slinky's I used since I began playing as a kid. You have to work a little harder with the nickels for bends and intonation but I like the tone and feel overall and I think it's made me a more precise player."
1,5,"I've used D'Addario strings for a long time (been playing 20+yrs) and have always been satisfied with their tone. The balanced tension brings a new element to the game of guitar in that these are suppossed to be mathmatically matched to have the perfect degree of tension. Do I fully understand how this works... nope, but they sure do sound good. Their feel is a little more ""snappy"" than regular XL's in my opinion and they have nice clarity as well. Their sound is bright, just like their XL cousins. I think it's more of a ""feel"" thing than a sound thing with these balanced tensioned strings. Now if they could just disect the dna of my guitars and match the tension of the strings with my instruments...All in all a great product that I recommend to any electric guitarist."
1,5,"I've been using Slinky regular nickels for over 20 years on my electrics, and love them. I've tried various coated strings etc but always come back to Ernie for sound and value. But on my acoustics, it's been D'Addario J-16s since day one, and still is. Never had one bad set, out of over a hundred. I adore the sound and the reliability.So why have I never tried their e-git strings? Because the Slinkys are perfect. But I must say: so are these. I just put a set of 10's on one of my Strats, and they are as snappy yet not-too-bright as I could want. They really complement the single coil tones, especially the 2 and 4 out-of-phase positions, so if you're a Strat fan and love that tone, give these a shot.One thing that was odd but not a problem was how long these are. A few inches longer than most electric strings, in fact. No idea why, but if you have huge posts and like mega-wraps, here's your puppy. I only do a triple wrap max, so it's just more to cut, but hardly an issue.And no matter what the coated string fans say, those might stay clean longer,  but that brand-new-string ZING only lasts a few hours on any string, coated or not. So if you're recording and need maximum harmonics and overtones, or playing big gigs where tone is everything, I say stick with uncoated strings, and aside from Slinkys, these are the best I've played."
1,5,"I still had the original strings on an Epiphone LP-100 guitar I bought last November. I know that's bad, but buying strings can be complicated (and overwhelming). It was nice to get these through Vine and try them out.There is a definite difference in the sound of the guitar now that the new strings are on. It sounds cleaner and brighter.I wish I'd changed the strings when I first started learning to play because these are much easier to play. Now it's not much of an issue, but it would have made a difference when I was breaking in my fingers those many months ago.I would definitely buy these again, especially because they are so inexpensive."
1,4,"I've been playing D'Addario XLs in their standard  .010, .011 and .013 gauge sets for many years now, so I was curious to see how these new ""balanced"" sets would feel. I expected a more even feel across the fingerboard, but experienced something quite different- right off, the B string felt a lot stiffer.  Looking at the tension table D'Addario publishes it's clear why this is the case. In the traditional .01s, the B string has about 30% lower tension that the E and G. In these new sets, the B is at the same tension, which is to say it's under 40% more tension than the B in the traditional set. That's a significant increase.  If you're used to the lower tension, the ""balanced"" tension feels a lot stiffer at first.The higher tension string requires a different amount of compensation at the bridge, too, which means changing the setup- not easily done on a Telecaster, where changing the length of the B changes the length of the E as well. Being higher in tension, the new B should require more compensation, since it'll shift pitch even more when you depress/stretch it. Since my Tele is currently set up as close as I could get the E and B to perfect comnpensation, I didn't feel like playing with it.After playing a while, the set started to feel more natural to me. I don't think I'll be changing gauges on the Tele right away, as I have about a dozen .010s in stock as well as over a dozen .013s fro my archtop. But I may experiment a bit with the new gauges for my Epiphone Dot Custom, which I string with .011s. I'm wondering if the balanced sets will give me a more even string-to-string feel, and if so, it would be worth my effort to change over."
1,5,"I'm always looking for the perfect electric guitar strings, as is evidenced by my drawer full of spare string sets that I felt failed me for one reason or another. A set of these came my way & as I had just gotten a 1966 Fender Jaguar I did what I always do when I get a new guitar - I restring it even though the strings were practically new. I could immediatly tell the difference in both feel & sound. The sound was crisper than the super slinkys that were on it & they felt good to my fingers. The only reason I took them off was because the Jag was for surf music & I wanted heavier gauge so I put these on my Tele, which was a match made in heaven. They sounded great but most telling is that after a month or so of heavy usage they still sound great. Reasonable price, great sound & long lasting. To me thats a perfect combo. Highly recommended!!!"
1,4,"I put these on a Parker.  Great that they have uniform tension.  Took a bit to get used to, but they are very playable.  vlues, rock, country.  Nice strings."
1,5,"I generally use D'addario with my acoustic guitar only, but I decided to try it out on the electric and I am very satisfied. It has the same light feel as their acoustic product, but it can make all the sweet tones I want it to when hooked up to an amp. I'm not sure on how long it lasts because I only put them on the guitar a few days ago, but they seem just as perfect as they were when I put them on. I would recommend you try these strings on your guitar because they work for me."
1,4,"Strung these up on my LP Goldtop with P-90's.D'Addario promises these strings to be ""comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations"" that result in ""greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings.""I dunno anything regarding the science behind this, but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker A and D strings compared to the regular set of D'Addario 10s they offer.  Its not a huge huge difference, but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance.For one thing, they're pretty stiff.  They bend, but not easily.  Maybe that's what they mean by ""Balanced tension.""  They're also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s.  Not flatwound mellow, by any means, but not quite as bright as your regular set of 10s.  I do get a great rock tone out of them, mind you, but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound.  Personally, I like the tone I get out of them, they're big and warm without being dull sounding, but again, your preferences might differ.One thing that's GREAT about these strings is, once they're properly stretched, they stay in tune FOREVER!  Again, maybe this is part of the ""balanced tension,"" and if so, good job D'Addario.I haven't had them on forever to really see how long they last, but they've been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one.Who would these appeal to?  Well, if you like really light strings that bend easily, you're not going to like these.  If you're a rythm player who does long gigs, the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you!"
0,3,"D'Addario strings are like the Kias of the string world. They make cheap products that cost a lot less but last a lot less time. These strings are OK...I've always been partial to Nickel wound (particularly semi-flatwound, but I digress). My typical strings are Elixirs, so I'm used to them lasting a long time. In this case, the strings sound good...like most nickel strings do. But they didn't last long at all before they started sounding dull and lifeless, and stopped keeping intonation accurately. So, like most D'Addario strings. So...they're not bad, but don't expect them to last like Elixirs do. You get what you pay for."
1,5,"I have tried so many brands of guitar strings in the past 20 years. I just keep coming back to these. The sound isn't quite as bright as the phosphorus bronze, but it is more of a acoustic guitar sound, anyway. These are clear, high quality and come sealed in tight plastic so the strings aren't exposed to air until you open them. Because of that little ""difference"" they do stay clean much longer than the brands simply wrapped in paper. I just can't think of a single complaint."
1,5,"The D'Addario EXL110BT Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Balanced Tension Regular Light are great! I've been a long time fan of D'Addario strings and these strings did not disappoint.They were very easy to string my Fender Strat with and stayed in tune a good long time. The strings had a good feel to them as well.Where I noticed the Balanced Tension the most was when I played chords. You know how you have tuned your guitar and it's tuned as well as it's going to be tuned but, when you strum that first chord something just doesn't sound right? You check the tuning and it's tuned alright but why isn't it sounding right?These strings gave a clear, clean sound when I strummed those chords. Bar Chords were terrific too. Impressive.I think I have some new favorite strings for my Strat!"
1,5,"This is the most awesome loop pedal ever!!! does the trick perfect, you can remove and add in elements to your loop! super small, only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered."
1,5,"This looper distinguishes itself by really only doing one thing but doing it really really well at a very affordable price.  To record you simply press the button and the led will turn red, continue playing.  When done simply tap again and the LED goes to green and plays back.  At any time in the looping process if you want to overdub simply tap the button and record and tap to finish.  No need to line it up with the loop, it places your overdub exactly where you played it in the loop.  If you don't like the take a simple press and hold will erase the overdub. Want to stop and clear (two presses and press and hold) and your back to a clean slate.  I don't know the limit of overdubs but I haven't reached it.  The amount of time for the looping I believe is 5 min so you can record an entire song and overdub to your hearts content.  The tone preservation is excellent and haven't noticed any issues there.  You can get a nice variety if you put this at the end of your effects change so that you can record a rhythm that is dirty and crunchy and overdub and record, then turn off your distortion and overdub a very nice clean lead over it.  If I have something I like, I then output it to Sonar to play with some more.Pros- Small, very easy to use (1 level knob and a stomp button), designed by guitarists and it shows, true bypass and plenty of room for recording.Cons- You may consider lack of battery a con, I don't, everything goes on the effects rack and is powered through AC.  No drum track or click track but then again, the aim for this device was to keep is simple, I believe.UPDATE: I was having an issue with the looper one night being able to record but not hear myself.  I contacted support and their response was quick but they basically said it sounds like it is broken, replace at the store which I did.  It worked great then one night again, I couldn't hear myself recording.  I played for about an hour with different configurations, it seems not all 9V AC adapters are equal.  Out of the 4 I have it only liked 2.  When I used that adapter it seemed to work just fine.  So beware if you are having an issue you might want to look at the 9V AC Adapter."
1,5,"Small footprint, simple to use, one button, one knob and does not suck tone out of my guitar. It's only got a basic feature set but that's all I need. Reasonable price too. Highly recommended."
1,5,"This compact looper sits as the last effect in my effect loop. It doesn't take a lot of space on my pedal board and it's simple to use. I've used the Boss RC-20 and the Digitech Stereo Jam Man. Although the others have more features, I like this little pedal.It took a little time to get use to the one button operation, but I find this to be very reliable. I've owned mine since the day they came out and I have had no issues."
1,5,I can become VERY creative with this pedal and do a good many things in a great many settings.I have other musicians online who jam with me and I can really do more than a handful of things in showing them where I am going with a song.So many things I have developed.Great tool and good quality product.
1,5,"Pros: works really well and is easy to use. The sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine, too. It is amazing how you can add layers upon layers without any loss of quality.Cons: it takes a bit to get accustomed to the timing, not lest because the switch is somewhat sticky and requires some extra effort, which has an impact on the timing. Also, the LED is placed too close to the switch, so you tend to cover it up with your foot. They should have put it higher up right next to the dial.Overall impression: The positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives. It's a great and inexpensive looper."
1,5,"I bought this hoping it would be a no-frills looper and that's what I got.  It sounds great and the level adjustment works really well.  I can layer even as many as 10 or 12 layers and hear every one without problem.  I give this five stars, but I have two minor quibbles that in my mind don't take away from the rating but might be important to some:1) there is no included power supply.  If it doesn't take batteries, that's fine, but give me an adapter.  This thing was over a hundred dollars. Don't force me to buy an accessory just to power it up.2) Personally I wish there was an option to remove layers in the order they were added (not just removing the last layer, or all the layers).  I'd like to be able to build up a song with layer on top of layer- moving to a crescendo - and then back off the layers one at a time, eventually returning to a single layer.  I played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it.  I started with one part, and then added layer after layer until I had a really big intricate sound.  It would have been nice to be able to then take it back down to a single part and then quietly end the song.This is a wonderful little looper.  You won't be disappointed."
1,5,"WOW! If you want 5 minutes of no-nonsense, clean looping and overdubbing,...the tc electronics DITTO pedal will not disappoint! I have been exploring the fringes and outer limits of guitar FX for over 30 years and this one has, in just two days, become one of my Top Five 'Gotta Have' effects. It is so simple that a five year old could make great loops, and it add ZERO addition sound to your signal. Placed at the end of your pedalboard, which is easy to do because of the DITTO's tiny footprint, the possibilities for live stunts and grooves is mind-blowing. And you can't beat the price. I've uploaded a 5m workout that I recorded on my 2nd day using the DITTO if you'd like to hear it - a solo improvisation for Telecaster and reverb. [...]"
1,5,"Wow, for the size, this is amazing.  Plenty of time and does everything you want from a looper.  Nothing else to say it's great, if you're in the market for one, get it."
1,5,For performing I'd go with something a little higher quality replay and more features but for rehearsing lead lines and solos over your own rhythm playing this is a great little unit at a good price. Would definitely purchase it again.
1,5,"TC just does things right.  I love how easy this is to use, the incredible clarity of sound, and 5 minutes of recording time.  I do a single, duo, and full band.  It goes with me to all gigs and I do use it for when I am practicing.  Highly recommended solution."
1,5,"I've had a Jam Man for some time, which as a tech person, I've found incredibly difficult to figure out. Perhaps I didn't take the time...ANYWAYS... this pedal on the other hand is a 100% leap forward in the opposite direction. I didn't need instructions, just punched in, layed down a riff, and jammed for about 2 hours straight. I did this for two days in a row. It's simple, built well, and and fun to use. Can't recommend it enough. It will improve your playing, and should be a required tool for guitar players."
1,5,"what a great little gizmo....I had a Boss RC-3 Looper,,,,,it involved too much bending over for me,,.and too hard to figure out...,the Ditto is so easy.,,,I take my trusty Fender Esquire...a cord...plug the chord in to a Caitlinbread Echorec pedal....take a short cable from the output of the Echo pedal to the input of the DIitto pedal.....then connect output of the Ditto to the amp....set Echo for multiple head repeats..i like the setting between 7 and 8 on the program select knob,,,,then turn OFF the echo pedal.....get ready to play....play the slow 4 chords to Maggot Brain....Eminor..D...Bminor...C.....count each chord as 123  456..as you come to start back on the Eminor,,,,,press the Ditto button one time with your foot,,,it will record you...,.play in tempo...!.,....its slow,,,,when you come back to the Eminor , you want to press the Ditto switch one time  to stop recording right before the 1 count,,,its tricky.,to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat,,...,.but easy with practice...anyway,....as soon as you press the Ditto switch to end the recording,,,,it will automatically start playing it back.,,then,....you turn on the Echo pedal....and proceed to jam on Maggot Brain.,,.,,till you achieve groovy-ness...,you don't want to record the rhythm part on to the  Ditto  with the Echo engaged,,,,that would make too much echo,,,,with both  the playback and the part you play on top of it, both echo drenched,,,,no good,,,,,that would be way too echo crazy..,it sounds much better and more effective  with a dry loop track and a super wet echo second guitar part,,,have fun..."
1,5,Definitely the best looper I've come across. Lots of looping time; simple to use; unlimited overdubs.Really can't go wrong with the Ditto!
1,4,"Perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyone's pedal board.  Many complain about not being able to use it during a live performance because of the single foot switch and they are right.  Having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting.  The ditto is great for practice, though."
1,5,"This looper is serious worth every cent I spent on it. Very simple, easy to use, and takes up less space on my pedal board than my Altoids tin. The sound quality is perfect, I can record a loop and play it back through this thing and it still sounds like I am playing instead of a recorded loop (assuming I end the loop correctly). I run this in my effects loop of my ac-30's after the preamp and all the distortion I run beforehand (big muff, od, boost) all get captured clearly coming out of this pedal. The range of the loop level is perfect, just over noon and you match the input signal and over that allows you to boost your loop for a little more dynamics.I chose those over the digitech jamman express xt and I have to say it was worth the extra money, even though the sales person was a little disappointed.If you want a simple loop this is the one, it takes a little learning but once you figure it out you will love it."
1,5,"I've owned Loop Stations, DM-4s, Jam Mans, Samplers and all that jazz. They're all full of crap you dont need. This pedal has flawless, colorless sound quality. It records what you sound like. You click it on, record your riff, click it and listen to it loop. Tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over. You can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers. Smallest, Cheapest, easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find. If you need all the drum loops and the ability to save loops for later use, then dont get this one, but if you just want a good way to jam with yourself or a live loop similar to the DM-4 but with more time on the loop then yes get this."
0,1,"Amazon and TC Electronics will not tell you that you need a 9V Power Supply. I didn't see any warning or advise in the Point of Purchase, nor in the package. This is an unfair practice from Amazon and TC Electronics."
0,1,"Let me start by saying that this is a really cool pedal, and TONS of fun. I can see how this could make you a better player and i think it could also be used live.BUT (and this is a big but) this is my first ""one star"" review ever...My first ""less-than-5-star-review"" ever...same as others, switch failed less than ten days of owning it. used less than ten times total, light use at home, I wasn't even wearing shoes! By the way, a gigging/recording musician for over 25 years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff. Bummer too GREAT idea....poorly executed.I will not buy anther one. I will not recommend to other musicians."
1,5,"I always wanted a Boomerang III looper, which at almost $500 was not really a justifiable expense for me.  Then, I found this for about $100, and I immediately sprung for it.  This is a great practice tool.  All it does is make loops.  The learning curve is very low, and there's no limit to the number of loops you can layer other than the total 5-minute recording time.  There are no quirky timing issues to be found here; your own ability to keep time and rhythm will always dictate how good you are at making loops.  This does take some getting used to, but it makes you a much better musician in the process; your drummer and bassist will thank you.This could possibly even be used as a live performance tool, although you'd have to be very, very proficient with this tool and be playing very, very tightly in the pocket.  I personally am not a good enough musician to ever want to risk doing something like this, lest something go wrong on stage (and lest I subsequently find myself impaled on a drumstick).Students would be especially encouraged to get one of these.  My playing has definitely grown and improved since I finally broke down and bought a looper."
1,5,This is very simple to use and it records for 5 minutes....so that is awesome! The playback sound is very good quality.
1,5,"I had previously owned it Digitech jam man, I also try the boss.After seeing demos of this item on YouTube I decided  I'll give it a try, I can always return it if I didn't like it.The unit is extremely small but don't let that fool you. This unit is a high-quality all metal construction it has simple easy operation and it works flawlessly. You get up to five minutes to record a loop for loops and you can get an infinite number of overdubs. Let's be serious how many people really Loop for over five minutes?The unit is transparent when turned off I would highly recommend this Looper it's well worth the money."
1,5,"I'm a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever.am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43. That being said using the looper was an eye opener. I bought it as a learning aide , to loop a progression and then try and run some pentatonics over the progression. The thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression I played. There's no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing. Let's just say I'm not as close to being a player as I thought and I would &#34;not&#34; figured this out for quite some time if not for the looper. So it is an amazing critic for us beginners . And if your like me ( and you experienced guitarist ) you saw all the demos online and know what you as an experienced player can use it for. It's an incredibly easy to use piece of equipment , after playing around with it for about 5or 10 mins you'll have the gist of it. From what I understand it's very basic compared to other loopers , i dont know anything about that but if your looking for just a simple to use looper this will definitely be to your satisfaction."
1,4,"This little simple looper sure is a ton of fun. Beware that there is a learning curve to looping. With trial and error you can get your groove going seamlessly after a while. I'm a little disappointed with the sound quality of the loop playback, could be better. I use this mainly with a double neck bass/guitar. Compliments well."
1,5,"Tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years. Their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception. Excellent sound quality, premium fit and comfort for wearing all day as we do at the station. You can't go wrong with these, we're ordering 8 more pairs!"
1,5,"I've tried these out in head-to-head (excuse the pun) runs versus Steelseries, Plantronics, Panasonic, and Sony headphones that all cost more... and the Tascam TH02 keeps up!I'm really surprised at how well they perform.  Lows are good, mids are clean, and highs are crisp.  Yes, the lows could be a bit beefier, but out of the headphones I compared it to, only the Plantronics excelled in that area.For fit: I have a large noggin; like, size 7 5/8 hat.  And these headphones fit well!  Not too tight, snug, but not confining. The padding is good and soft.Seriously, I'd rather buy three of these and burn through them if they break (which they haven't, and I've taken them everywhere) than spend $100 on another set."
1,5,These headphones get the job done. I like the build and design. Very loud and great to use studio style headphones for my filmmaking needs.
1,5,"These headphones are 100% amazing. I could not believe the sound quality. I have been an audio engineer for over 30 years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth $200-$300...nice wide spectrum and frequency response, you will love them, well worth the price. (no I do not work for Tascam)... the first pair I bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easily....so I ordered another pair, because the sound is amazing, I just need to be more careful next time!!...but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction...I have yanked my Senhieser's millions of times and the cord never broke, so be careful with the cord on this headphone...it is not the best, but the sound is superior."
0,3,"I only just received these, but thought I'd give my first impression. I purchased headphones because I figured it was a more pleasant way to listen to music at work than in-ear type. I chose this model because they were on sale, seemed to be a diamond in the rough, and reviews indicated it would be good for large heads(I wear an XL hat size).The build is average. They don't feel flimsy in my hands, but you can see the plastic parts are nothing special, strength-wise. The padding for the headband is a little uneven on the seam, as you open up the headband to put the unit on your head, it sort of looks warped. The 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone. The headphones can both swivel 90 degrees forward, maybe 35 degrees back, and 90 degrees downward. The swivel joint above the ear pieces allow them to fold upward into the headband.I listened to about 45 minutes of music straight to start, and was pretty pleased. I'm not especially particular, but do like good sound. There's some good bass, classical music was clear. The headphones did make me realize I had low quality recordings for a few of my songs that I tried out(listening to the HD equivalent on YouTube cleared up problems I heard). I wasn't totally blown away, either. I do hear a little noise when they're plugged into my computer and nothing is playing, though not so for my iPod(so I'm not sure if this can be blamed on the headphones).They are comfortable, but not as comfortable as I'd like. I do feel some pushing against my ears, the round ear pads aren't big enough to fit my whole ear. They do get warmer than I'd like. I definitely feel relieved to have them off. I think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour. I was a little hesitant to get over-ear headphones in fear of this, and unfortunately it did turn out to be a problem.Who knows, maybe they'll wear in and improve. I'll update this review if I have more to report. For now, I'd say they're worth the cost, even if they aren't a shining diamond in the rough. If I could give about 3.5 stars I would; but for now, I'll give 3. They are accurately priced, and overall a typical quality product. Some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons.Update 7/19:I've been stretching out the headphones on a box for a couple days, it's helped a bit. What's funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge! It's comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notches...but the pushing against your head is the tight part. If you adjust them larger, they just fall below your ears, rather than loosen up.Also, I compared them to the Sennheiser HD201. The TASCAMs have better sound, but the Sennheiser is more comfortable(they're lighter and the ear cups are oval shaped and fit better).Update 7/23:I think the box stretching has been helping, I'm able to wear them for about 2 hours now before I notice them getting uncomfortable. Still a relatively short amount of time.Update 8/9/2013:The headphones have been living on a box just wider than my head anytime they aren't in use. The comfort is marginally improving, I'm guessing due to the stretching out, my head/ears getting used to the pressure, and me learning ways to sort of adjust them periodically to shift the pressure. However, I think my rating will remain at 3 stars. The sound is good enough to give it a couple stars, and the price low enough for one more. However, a month should be long enough for the phones to break-in to a standard usable degree, and that hasn't happened to my satisfaction.CONCLUSION: I would suggest you find a different pair if you have an exceptionally big head(mine is about 24""/61cm circumference, or US hat size 7 and 5/8). The clamping definitely leads to discomfort, the round ear pads don't quite do the trick, and it makes your head pretty warm. It's not unbearable, but if you can find an alternative it's probably best. That being said, note that I have only reduced stars for the fit!! I can't speak for someone with a bit smaller of a head(and ears?)...if these fit comfortably, which I imagine they would for many people, they are a 5 star product! Great sounding, sturdy enough build, etc.Update 11/14/13:A friend of mine picked up a pair of Audio-Technica M50s around the same time I bought this pair, and I was able to try them out and compare for a good half hour today. I'm not very experienced with sound quality, but I felt that the M50s were definitely the winner. The most obvious difference was the added volume, but generally the sound was more pleasing to my ears. The bass seemed more supported, higher notes felt smoother and less static-like, etc. Besides the volume, these differences weren't huge. I had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them. The point of this update is just to say that you aren't getting $150 headphones for $30 with the TASCAMs. You are getting very good headphones, the sound of which should more than satisfy most people. I think you're pursuing diminishing returns in sound quality alone to pay much more than this for headphones(in this case, you'd pay 5X more for the M50s...but I don't think you're getting 5X the sound quality). The M50s are significantly more comfortable(though they do make your ears warmer), and the build feels better(stronger, smoother adjustments, prettier, etc.). All these things combined, and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable."
0,2,"Soooo bummed. I simply love the sound on these cans, but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface (not deep enough in the cups) and press down hard on my ears. The max time I can wear them is like an hour, and then I can't wear them for a day or so due to residual pain. I guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups, that might help. Also, on most of my other phones, the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces, while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet. So it's kind of like double trouble. However, these really do have great sound (especially the tight bass clarity). If it weren't for the discomfort factor, I would be using them all the time. As of now, I hardly use them at all. In fact, when I first tested these out, I was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more. But I'm glad I waited to really give them a more prolonged test. Of course, we are all of varying shapes and sizes, ha ha, so they might work for you where they don't for me. If so, you've got a bargain on some great cans. If not, ouch. Cheers!"
1,4,although im not onstage bouncing aroung...they hold the strap on just fine...no changing hardware like strap locks...yes..more colors so they would stay hidden would be nice...but i will order more..
1,4,"so I never had the luxury of the Grolsch brand strap locks.I tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe, but alas, I was too slow.It's a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a Carlsberg bottle cap.So the Fender ones will do just fine, plus they come in 2 colors and say Fender.Time to open another Carlsberg, cheers Fender."
1,5,"My Epiphone SST Classic didn't have the strap pin, so I took it to a place where they put the pin in the wrong place, as I don't want to do another hole to my guitar, I left it there, but I'm afraid that the strap would come off and my guitar hit the ground, so I bought these Fender strap blocks, and I use it on my two Epiphone guitars that I can't use the Planet Waves Strap lock with. My other Epiphone guitar is an Epiphone Hummingbird.They work great!! I would buy these again."
1,5,This is a good product. These work very well and are inexpensive and easy enough to put on. I like.
1,5,An amazing cheap solution but the dunlop strap pins are the best way to go overall but i defiantly trust these on my guitar. 2 months and no problems yet
1,4,Its a good amp im happy with it. The high gain is not the best a lot of unwated noise even while playing and i see a few people on here have had the same problem. But i mostly play punk/hardcore and blues which is does very well. So when im in a metal mood i use a BOSS metal zone pedal on a clean BUTCHER seting and no unwated noise even at loud volumes. so its good amp i just wish i didn't need to use pedals to get good metal sound thats why i got this amp so could get rid of my pedals o well
1,4,"I have the Fender Mustang IV and I would say the fender is a superior modeling amp, but if you want to use an amp for bass and acoustic guitar as well as a modeling amp this is the amp to get. The bass sounds great and when I played Here Comes the Sun on my acoustic, I'd swear the tone sounded like the Beatles record. The modeling sound is ok  and they tell me there's a looper here but i'd have to pay an  extra $120 for a pedal to access it. Oops, there goes a star for the con job. Peavey could have easliy included or at least offered a pedal for much less. I'll wait and pick up a pedal used in the future."
1,5,"Great little amp. I replaced a 35 year old Fender chorus with this. No comparison. I have it below 1 on the volume and it is still loud. The factory setup is great, but you can set it up anyway you want it."
1,5,"This is an awesome amp. There are SO many settings on this amp you could spend hours with news sounds and effects, so sick! It's fun experimenting with different effects and mixing them to something new. Sometime I want to get the pedal for this amp to preset effects I like. Great amp if you're just looking for something to either mess around on or practice with. I play a lot of different songs on my electric guitars and this amp makes it really fun. I would recommend this to a beginner to an advanced player."
1,5,"VERY VERY loud electric guitar amp! As a bass player, I was shocked that 40W could be that loud for guitar. I can't raise the volume above 1 in my house. When you switch it to acoustic or bass mode, the volume decreases dramatically, but it is a great amp for guitar players who also play bass occasionally.Excellent top quality features. Beautiful sound for each of the different modes. The acoustic setting really made my cheap electric guitar SOUND like it was an actual acoustic. The amp simulation is top notch.Awesome value for the price!Edit: I've played through it more as a bass amp and after turning some dials and trying out the different settings....I'm even MORE impressed. One of the reasons the volume for bass was so much lower was that the default gain is at zero. I brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and BOOM....huge sound. I play with a 18 piece dance band and usually bring my Hartke kickback for that group. After experimenting more, I would not hesitate to use the Peavey for rehearsals and performances with that band.I still can't get over the fact that it is a 40W amp. The sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage."
1,5,I have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless. Easy export to Protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo.
1,4,"The DP-008EX Pocketstudio is the next generation design of the DP-03 Digital Portastudio. I have access to both units and hope to compare them as well as describe the DP-008EX on its own terms, pointing out features and issues important to me (mostly workflow-related) as someone who grew up home-recording with analog equipment.(If you want all the details of the full functionality I'd recommend downloading the manual from TASCAM or a dealer site that offers it.)Speaking of the manual I found it to be essential, at least at first. There are so many features that it will likely take some time to explore and incorporate them so having a copy handy (or better yet downloading a second copy) is a good idea.This is picky but I found the larger size of the DP-03 manual easier to read and handle than the smaller DP-008EX.I've used software-based DAWs for years and, while I enjoy MIDI recording, mixing, and editing with them, basic audio tracking never felt as comfortable or spontaneous as when I used analog equipment. I have a one-room home studio with minimal acoustic treatment and, aside from PC noise, I miss the simplicity and tactile response of my old MK-II cassette 4-track:  Instant power on, press record/pause, ready-set-go.  Granted, I don't miss the `wall of hiss' that plagued those recordings but I had fun capturing a lot of musical moments.Using a hardware control surface with my DAW didn't solve the problem - I just find the reality of booting Windows, dealing with the inevitable patching and other software distractions to be too toxic to the creative moment - especially when recording acoustic instruments.I hoped the DP-008EX would provide some of that older experience - with digital audio quality in a size that would integrate easily with my existing setup.The bottom line for me is: It does and it doesn't.First some comparison points that may not be obvious from the product images in the descriptions:Size-wise, the difference between Porta and Pocket studios is roughly 11 1/2 x 2 x 8 inches versus 8 3/4 x 1 3/4 x 5 inches. TASCAM doesn't provide a case or cover for the DP-008EX but a larger eReader or tablet case should do fine and I'd recommend one if you plan on portable use - the plastic appears fairly durable but it's still plastic.The knobs on the DP-008EX are smaller in diameter, lower, and have rounded tops compared to those on the DP-03. However, I find their slightly `rubbery' matte finish just as easy to grip. I also find the smaller, circular pushbuttons on the DP-008EX don't protrude above the surface as much as the larger bar-shaped buttons on the DP-003 and are less comfortable to use.The data wheel is identical in size and has a bit less resistance on the DP-008EX which I prefer - the wheel gets a workout and you want responsiveness when selecting from menus.You'll need the dedicated PS-P520 5v power supply for the DP-008EX; the 12v PS-1225L for the DP-03 can't be shared. (The plug won't fit so you can't fry it - and don't even think of using batteries when recording anything you take seriously).  On the other hand, the Teac RC-3F footswitch is sharable - you'll need a mini plug to phone adaptor - but I think it's indispensable if you're working alone.Speaking of power, a strong plus for both recorders (and for me a deal-breaker were it not present) is phantom mic power so you're not limited to the built-in stereo condensers. They're not bad for rough work but, unlike mic stand-mounted portables, it would be a challenge to position this unit close to some instruments and vocals. I can get a decent acoustic piano recording in a good-sounding room but for close mic recording of guitar (acoustic or electric amp), violin, or percussion I want the flexibility of a mic stand and better quality mics.I like the resistance of the faders on the DP-03, but I can understand how the lack of real estate kept them off the DP-008EX. There's no CD burner either on the smaller unit but with USB 2.0 transfer capability, that's not an issue for me.Having similar XLR, phono and RCA jacks along the back edge of both units is an acquired taste. I'm not  bothered by it because I have space to run the cables but it's worth considering your physical layout and whether that works for you.The LED screen appears to be identical in size on both units and that leads me to my main workflow issues:The flat positioning of the screen makes using the unit on a flat surface less comfortable than it should be - especially since the menu is used so much. A slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking for design trouble:  I do woodworking and made myself a simple stand that slants at 25 degrees and doesn't interfere with jack access - it makes a tremendous difference on my neck and upper back while reading the screen and for general use. TASCAM should consider a similar accessory.The software is largely the same for both units, aside from additional mastering `tools' (essentially packaged presets), and here lies my major criticism: I feel a real conflict between directly accessing functionality (i.e. levels, EQ, arming tracks) with dedicated knobs and buttons, and being forced to indirectly access other functionality using what I see is an inflexible, constraining menu  system.If there were some way to customize the menu navigation (the equivalent of software hot-keys) it's possible the frequent repetition of non-functional steps such as pressing the home button and selecting with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they do.The best evidence of an unbalanced design I see is the dedicated Phantom power button on both units whose purpose is - to display the ""Phantom"" screen where you then make a selection to turn the power on and off! That crystallizes for me the hybrid character and compromises made here between software-based recording and using a dedicated hardware recorder.When space for knobs and buttons is severely limited I can understand the design thinking and trade-offs that drive having so much functionality accessible through the menu. But the DP-008EX is stuffed with knobs and buttons and even my first multi-tracker, a Fostex X-15, effectively doubled-up the functionality of two tracks to cover four.  So I have to question whether the trade-offs TASCAM made here in fact diminish the user experience.With connectivity and software-based recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving, I believe the market for dedicated hardware recorders such as the DP-008EX will be largely made up of people like me who grew up with older recorders and are looking to recapture some of that experience. I think TASCAM would be well-served taking that into account.I've always liked the design of TASCAM gear; it just looks and feels well-made, and that's still in large part true of the DP-008EX. But I can't help believing that a simple digital equivalent of my old MK-II cassette 4-track would satisfy a lot of people out there (and not to mention make a terrific hack for someone with the electronics chops to pull it off!)."
1,5,"The Tascam DP-008EX is great!!! I love this little box! It's got a lot of features packed into a small unit about half the size of your average laptop. Here are a few of the features that I really like about it...1. It's portable and runs on 4AA batteries.2. It has compression, exciter & de-esser as well as EQ and Reverb.3. It has a mastering section with effects.4. You can record 8 tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks.5. It feels sturdy (not that I would drop it)....just to name a few.  I compared this against the Fostex MR8mkII, which I also own and like. The Tascam has more features for the buck, as well it should as it just came out this year and the Fostex has been around a while. As another reviewer put it, this won't replace your DAW. I can record some very polished songs on my laptop, but the Tascam does come close. The mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too. I have recorded a few songs on this already and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. The portability factor is huge in my opinion. Being able to take it downstairs when the kids are upstairs, or vice versa, is great. Plus it's fun to record vocals in the bathroom and kitchen areas.I totally recommend this for any songwriter who wants a nice scratchpad to put down ideas in a quick and creative manner... and then polish them up a bit in the mastering section. FIVE STARS!!!"
1,4,"As with any new device or toy we buy we discover the good and bad points...first the good....THE GOOD: 8 tracks that can be recorded 2 at a time...has RCA outs which is good for monitors and or headphone amp as well as a 1/8"" headphone out...a durable feel, a nice design, XLR inputs with phantom power, lit screen to see better (Very Nice)... wav 16bit 44khz recordings, auto punch in, comes with a 2gb card and can take up to 32GB SD cards...has effects has a metronome, mastering internal track apart form the 8 tracks, built in guitar tuner, EQ, Compression in and out, nice dual stereo up front mics that are real good sounding and all 8 track mixing, bouncing to 2 of your tracks  even the tracks that are bounced to, the previous tracks 'that are there' that still are plying bounce too, very cool...and much more....THE BAD: short battery life, No AC adapter included, need to buy (Cheap off ebay around $8.00)...small buttons, bad sounding reverbs, auto punch in gives you 2 seconds after pushing buttons to record, COME ON TASCAM, 2 SECONDS!!!!!?????? I can't get back into recording part with a guitar in 2 lead in seconds all alone!!!!! No guitar effects or Drum patterns like Boss's BR Micro 4 and 80...(boss has it's problems too, believe me)sometimes it just hangs up, (think there is an unlock or reset pen press thing on the side)HORRIBLE REVERBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!moreEven though this untit has its good and not so goods, it is a great device, you can import and export songs to this to and from your computers recording software, remember its 16 bit wavs only to and from DAW.....Tascam please lengthin the auto punch lead in from 2 seconds to 5 seconds or more on next firmware and dont make another new unit just to improve what a firmware can do!!!....Jim"
1,4,"Tascam had the first inexpensive multitrack recorder on the market, and even as competitors entered the market they've managed to stay on top. I've owned or borrowed models from Fostex and Korg going back several decades but Tascam always seems to be out in front when it comes to ease of use and value. Even as the market evolved from cassette to digital, Tascam recorders have kept the same feel and ease of use. I had a Boss Micro BR-80 for a while, but I found the all-menu interface annoying and difficult to use. I kept forgetting the sequences to set up rhythm tracks, record, and mix down, and ended up having to repeat things over and over. I soon sold it, and then replaced it with a Tascam DP-004 when that appeared on the market. The Tascam wasn't really any more powerful than the Boss, and lacked the built in rhythm tracks, but it had fewer menus and more actual switches and knobs that made it more intuitive in use, and more like an actual mixing board or traditional cassette-based recorder.After the DP-004 Tascam produced a follow-on six track unit and this recorder, the 8-track DP-008. When it was first introduced a couple of years ago it really was a revolutionary unit. There were plenty of 8-track recorders out there, but none that were that small and that inexpensive. It's also more than just a DP-008 with more tracks. The DP-008 has a much improved mastering ability that allows you to adjust EQ, compression, and effects individually on tracks for the mix down, while leaving the original tracks unaffected. Like the DP-004, it has built in microphones and can also be used for direct stereo recording. Unlike the DP-004, it comes with an external power supply in the box (a $24 option with the original 004) and can use an external battery pack.I've been playing with my 008 all weekend, doing a mixture of stereo and multitrack recordings. One thing I noticed right off was that there's a significant amount of noise in the monitor mix while multitracking. I was afraid this would translate into noisy recordings, but the noise isn't there in the finished playback. I also noticed that while the basic recording functions are more or less unchanged from those on the 004, the new mixdown functions are much more complex and required constant reference to the manual. As mentioned previously, there's an awful lot of capability there and it's going to take some time to be able to use it effectively. Most of that functionality is menu-based, rather than being accessibly directly from the front panel, and I have to say that's one thing I don't really care for. The only input device you have to select functions and parameters and menus is a scroll wheel that's not nearly as comfortable as a knob or a mouse or touchpad.Most of my recording lately has been done with various Apple platforms. At home, I use Garage Band on my iMac and a USB-equipped Alesis console for input. Away from home I use Garage Band on my iPad and (for ultimate portability) iPod Touch. All of these platforms are much more intuitive to use than the DP-008 and much more powerful. Of course, they're also a lot more expensive, and lack the built-in stereo microphones and ability to plug instruments and microphones directly in without some sort of additional interface. Having XLR connectors as well as 1/4"" inputs is a really nice touch, something you never saw on portables from a few years ago. I like the old-school approach of the DP-008 as well as the all-in-one package approach.If I was just starting out in home multitrack recording and didn't have a lot to spend, I think the DP-008 might be a good choice. It's really good enough to produce music for a band's first CD releases, and costs less than a decent microphone. WIth 8 full tracks there's no need to do track bouncing to get four instruments and four voices down, and if you really need to, you can bounce and add a further six tracks, giving you 14 in all. I don't think it's going to replace my iPod for pocket portability or my iPad for functionality (Garage Band gives me a full orchestra, keyboards and drums as well) but having the microphones and instrument preamps built in does make it much easier to set up and use for live recording. It should get a lot of use at my home and elsewhere in the coming year."
1,4,"Everything keeps improving, and getting better, faster, and cheaper, but at this price point their isn't one available that isn't a compromise in one way or another. First off if you are planning on buying the US-322 don't. Buy its bigger brother the US-366. Getting an optical connection and additional ins and outs for such a little bit more money, as well as 192k makes it a no-brainer. To get optical (on the 366 only) at this price is great, but the A/D D/A converters leave a bit to be desired. On the other hand the mic pres are pretty good, have distortion ratings, THD of only 0.0045% and with 24 Bit/192KHz recording make these the best sounding interfaces put out by Tascam to date.What I meant by a compromise is that even with interfaces that cost 3 to 5 times this price most of them have either good mic pres, and weak clocks, or vice versa, and some work with Windows but not so well with MAC and once again vice versa, etc. I researched interfaces for a long, long time, and considering non-crash reliability and a dozen other factors I finally sprung for anRME Fireface UFX USB 2.0 or Firewire High Performance audio interface 30 in, 30 out. Now that's an interface. I have been running it with Pro Tools 9 since 2011.Pro Tools 10- Professional audio recording and music creation softwareis out and Pro Tools 11 is now being released.So if you are looking for an inexpensive interface expect some compromises in one area or another. Rather than slam it out with performance specs under a microscope, I would rather provide a review helping those who are interested in setting up this Tascam US-322 or 366 so you can save a lot of time trying to figure it out. Sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved. So what I did was load, and register the free and included Cubase LE6 complete with activation and eLicense registration and installation as well as installing the Tascam driver, and doing updates for both. I know a lot of the reviews here just downloaded a driver and used their existing DAW in order to test out the interface, and therefore they didn't need to spend much time with it. I don't blame them; the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. So get out a cup of coffee because installing this complete package doesn't happen in just one hour. So here goes...If you have Windows Vista you are probably out of luck because the system requirements list Windows XP, 7, and 8. I am sure the omission of Vista is not a mistake. I know myLogitech AudioHub Notebook Speakersare non-functional in my Vista laptop if you are running Windows Media Center in it as well. It works in Win 7 just fine. So I installed it in my desktop running Windows 7 64 bit and it gives you the option of installing in 32 or 64. In addition to Cubase LE 6 it also installed AI Elements 6 as well as Agent One Content, Groove Agent One, Vintage Beat Boxes, Steinberg Drum Loop Expansion 01 which took a good amount of time to load, as well as Steinberg Halion Sonic SE 64 bit for AI Elements. I then had to activate and register Cubase LE6 which involves installing the latest eLcc, creating a Steinberg account (which is free and they don't ask you for a credit card). They provide you with an activation code after you register.I have an iLok for Pro Tools which is a USB device that enables you to run the program. Cubase does not require that you have one, although they have an equivalent looking device, but fortunately they have a software based equivalent. They do this with an eLicense which you will then update to version 6.5.4.1122. There is an eLicense control setup and you have a Soft eLicenser number that you will use in order to generate the Activation Code generated at the Steinberg site. What came on my disc was version 6.05 which they instruct you to immediately do an update, which I did to version 6.07.So we install the Tascam interface next which comes on a separate DVD. Included with the interface is a 5 foot USB printer style cable. You will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer. Windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver. So install the driver off of the disc first, and then do the update. It took at least 15 minutes to do that update. What flashed on the screen was 154 megabytes and then all you see is an install screen with a scrolling series of round objects moving. At first it says, ""This is going to take a long time"", and they were exactly right. It almost tempts you to think something is wrong, because nothing is happening other than the scrolling, and then finally after ten minutes or so a dialogue box comes up and says, ""Do you want to install?"" and you click continue, and then it comes up again in another minute, and this happens a few times, and then finally it changes over to an installation finished box. (I have Verizon FIOS and usually download huge amount of data in a flash). Then you reboot.Now this is important. Plug the US-322 directly into an available USB 2.0 port and not into a hub, even if it is a powered hub. It simply won't work. I tried it and the light wouldn't even come on indicating USB. When I went direct the interface lit up and it worked. The manuals also warn you not to use it with USB 1.1. The US-322 comes with a printed Quick Start Guide. There is also an owner's manual for both the Interface, and Cubase that are available either on the DVD, or by Googling the same and they come up as a PDF download. If you are new to setting up interfaces be prepared to do a good deal of reading. There is a driver to choose, input and output settings, as well as going into Windows Control Panel/Sound in order to choose the interface for playback, and recording. If you're new to these kinds of setups just take your time, and don't be dismayed if something doesn't work. All it takes is for one button to get pushed and Wahlah you have sound. For example in Cubase there is a monitoring button without it you won't get any sound from the headphones. If all else fails you can go to the Tascam web site by Googling Tascam US-322 and then click on the support tab, and they have a ""you pay for it"" phone call number in order to help you. Hope this helps.PS: The real killer deal right now is Avid Pro Tools 9 bundle with the MBox Mini which is another limited interface but you are getting Pro Tools 9. Plus purchases of this bundle made after 10/2011 that has pro tools 9 will be able to have a free upgrade to pro tools 10 if you register your product with Avid. Considering what Pro Tools goes for by itself, and what the MBox sells for individually, and the bundle even comes with the iLok you can sell it used for what you are paying for it, and even more than you are paying for it if you take advantage of the discounts I have seen pop up as much as 20% off the already low price. Then you have Pro Tools 9, and 10 full blown versions, none of this LE stuff, and an interface, and can grow from there. This Tascam interface works great with Pro Tools. These Pro Tools 9 bundles are discounted to make way for 11, and I am seeing music stores running out of them. They are clearing the shelves preparing for 11, but it has bugs. I rarely purchase totally new versions until they have time to season some, and get feedback from users. After some time, and more updates, I will be browsing the shelves for discounts on the upgrade to 11; maybe in another year. PT 9 is all I need."
0,3,"While the Tascam US-322 Audio Interface appears to be a powerful tool for home based recording, it also appears that it is designed to work only in tandem with the included Cubase LE software. I am not a novice at home recording, as I have used many devices from 4 track cassettes to ProTools setups over the years. Here is a rundown of my disappointing experience:1) plugged into my iPad using the camera kit USB connector - got ""device not compatible with iPad"" message. Too bad, but I can still use my ART USB interface which works quite well with Garageband.2) installed driver on my old, G4 Mac running 10.5.8; opened Garageband, got  ""no input"" message.Could not evaluate the Cubase software, as it requires Mac OS 10.6.8. If I get a new computer, I will update my review. Until then, I'm disappointed."
0,2,"I love Tascam gear, and have used it for nearly 30 years. I was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.While the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired. Also, the complete lack of a manual with the one I got made it very difficult understand the functions. (Sorry, but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 CDs of software, how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install CD?)There was a very small quick start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs, and outputs, and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen. I was forced into trial and error to see if I could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode. I could not. I could record and layer multiple tracks (I was using Audacity, didn't want to install Cubase), but I could not get playback from the previous tracks while I also had live input. Now this could have been my computer or Audacity, as it is an older Win XP machine, but it played back multiple tracks without problem.There was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this, or even hint where one should look, other than going to Tascam's web site. I'm sorry, but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive. There should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included with the product. If I am going to use this to do serious recording, the last thing I want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website, or worse, from ""user community"" threads in some blog.Which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included. I use mostly Linux, with only one Windows machine for software which I can't get on Linux. I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux but was under time constraints.Then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware. With a hardware mixer, I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. Computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time, and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. The controls on  this interface were very fussy, and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react. I found it very tedious, and again, no actual instructions were included to help with that process. With a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case? (Yeah, I know, touch screens are COOL.)Also, software based functions are always limited by your computer and OS, and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.I am old school, and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful. I know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers, and saving space, etc., etc. I value function over fashion, however, and that is what I have always liked about Tascam gear: it was supremely functional. This software falls far short of what I expect from Tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.Good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. The layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first, and takes some time to get comfortable with. Old Tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was helpful to aspiring recording artists. Not so here.I had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars, but sadly, it only rates a 2 (2.5 if I could) for me. Come on, Tascam, you can do better than this."
1,5,Awesome audio interface.  Perfect for my beginner studio setup. All set to trade my tracks with fellow musicians around the globe. Easy set up
0,3,"This unit is compact enough to take with you if you need a small interface to take along with your laptop for field recording.  It is powered via the USB bus, so you don't have to carry power supplies, or worry about finding an outlet for the device.One issue is that this is not a plug-and-play device.  You will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it.  After the driver was installed, I was able to get Pro Tools to recognize it right away without any issue.  I recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded.  It works like any other interface in Pro Tools, so you will be able to use it easily enough.  The mic pre-amps don't seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a 48v condenser microphone like the ones I use to record vocals and guitars.  I found that the overall sound quality was okay, but just okay. I wouldn't want to use this for anything important, but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals, or doing pre-production in a practice space.  I wouldn't recommend it for serious studio work though and I would rather drag my Pro Tools I/O rack to a location if I was in the field.The build quality is a bit suspect on this as well.  I noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when I picked it up after taking it out of the box.  It seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose.  I can move the top and bottom together and apart, making a clinking sound.  This can, of course, be taken care of very easily, but I would rather have a device come as it should.  I have never had a problem with a TASCAM unit before and I have had a ton over the years, so I hope this is just a one-off quality control issue.  The knobs feel okay, but there is a bit of play in the line out control and one of the attenuators is sticky.Bottom line: 3/5 starsRecommended for casual use, but not for commercial use"
1,5,Works perfectly.  Got the drivers for Mac from the website and it instantly showed up in core-audio. Very easy to use. Love it!
1,5,Purchased this and a comparable Hosa cable. This cable works flawlessly without crackles when guitar is moved. Hosa failed the test in both performance and easy coiling. I will stick to GLS products from this point forward.
1,5,"I ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised.  They are excellent quality, clear tone and a great look.  I was actually impressed with the room that the cables gave my tone and the clarity they have.  For Price and Quality these are top notch."
1,5,"Definitely the best combination of price, durability and sound quality that I've come across. Plus, the tweed look really grows on you.  Ordered a bunch for the studio, and a bunch more for home. Holds up well, even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on. Do it!"
1,5,"First of all, 20 ft is not too long. Better to have a little bit of extra length than too short. The cable works fine and is very flexible. Also looks nice and is easier to track than plain black ones. Recommended!"
1,5,"Constructed well, works perfectly, rolls up nicely with no kinks. The  20 foot guitar instrument cable is another quality product by GLS Audio."
0,3,"These are durable, but I get some noise from the cables. It's barely audible, but it's distracting nonetheless."
0,3,The cable tangles easily. Not stiff enough.It get's in the way and is hard to stay stretched out. But the color and the cloth cover is cool looking and has a more personal feel than the common rubber types. It also seem tightly put together at the ends.
1,4,"Satisfies my needs . . . nice cloth covered, large strain relied, good plugs (put a bit of thread lock on them they unscrew almost unintentionally) . . . . like it even if it's a bit long for use at home."
1,4,A friend made a comment that the cord looked like an old iron electric cord. LOL The cord delivers good sound quality. The only problem I have with it is that it gets tangled up rather easy.
1,5,This is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try I recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable.
1,4,Very nice quality. I've removed 1 star because of the 1/4 casing. The sheath likes to twist off a little too easily. I used plumbers thread tape and tightened it right up. Other than that. I've been using this cable regularly for a while and it works great.
1,5,This bit of leather and a button spared my acoustic surgery to add a second strap mount. I am happy with the function and it looks good in combination with an Ernie Ball strap. The raised star on the button adds a touch of design interest.
1,5,Works great.  Easy to use
1,5,"My acoustic only has the end pin strap button and none at the heel of the neck. I was using a bit of string to tie the strap to the headstock, but it was ugly. This, however, is a very attractive solution and quite sturdy to boot. Highly recommend."
1,5,"Leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap.  I would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button.  The button is not a snap, I just lack the word to describe it.  Previously I used to use a shoe lace and I would be thinking about it falling while playing.  Now I have more confidence with this strap.  It's not Gucci but doesn't feel like plastic either."
1,4,"... but... they're the cheesiest looking leather I've ever seen... real leather for sure, but somehow the maker found real leather that looks like cheap vinyl imitation leather."
1,5,"Yep. it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar. I have a Washburn rover, a backpacker style, and so a stap is a necessity, and this works just great."
1,5,"Works well with the AXL PG-515.  This is good quality for the price.  Snap is large and holds well; but is easy enough to unsnap when needed.  Its rare to need to remove this strap button because it slides out of the way, as needed."
1,5,"I am happy with the strap button that I purchased, however they sent me the wrong one.  No big deal."
1,5,"If you have to have a strap on your acoustic guitar, I would suggest this. I have a vintage 60s Dixon Hummingbird. I was really worried about scuffing it up. Don't worry with this."
1,5,"I wanted to put a strap on my acoustic guitar. Now it is easier to handle, when trying to play."
1,5,"Love it, I finally found one that supports my 12 strings Alvarez jumbo acoustic guitar"
1,5,This strap button works great. works so much better than the string around the neck thing.And looks better too!
1,5,"For some reason, when I saw &#34;48 picks&#34; I think of a sandwich baggie full of plastic picks... What I got was a slim resealable bag that's about 1/8th the size I was thinking of.  It comes with Light, Medium and Heavy picks.  Even the Light picks are thicker than the &#34;thin&#34; picks I had ordered before.  I like having the variety though.  This has a variety of colors as well as the thickness.The only thing that could have made this better is if it came with a drawstring on the bag so I could maybe hang it from my strap."
1,5,just love them came really quick love all the different colors and thicknesses in all the colors you can fined a fine med or heavy
1,5,I love this assortment.  Every color and size you'll ever need.  You can never have enough picks but this batch should keep you going for a while.  This was an exceptional value and the picks are of nice quality.  I would buy this again or recommend to anyone.  I use medium picks so would search for a large batch of these in medium only though.  Definitely a 5 star purchase.
1,5,"Love my assortment of picks and the price was right. I like that their is different gauges, because I don't always like using the same so this is great with the three different gauges to choose from in all these nice colours but I only received 47 instead of 48 picks but whose counting, i'm  still happy with my picks and would purchase from seller again, thanks."
1,5,I was given free picks when I bought my guitar from a local guitar shop in town. The Retailer gave me some mediums. I find I do better with heavy thickness. I have a heavy touch when I play the guitar. With the different thicknesses I can choose which works best for me. From experience it never hurts to have extra picks around. Since I bought these I have been using the Heavy thickness ones. They really bring out the extra sound in the strings on the guitar.
1,5,they are just great what more can I say They product is high quality and a good price I am enjoying them
1,5,A bonanza of handsome peal celluloid guitar picks in a variety of thicknesses.  An inexpensive way to find your favorite pick.
1,4,"I have about quit using picks now.  But I needed a variety pack to try different thicknesses.  That's what you get with this.  From very thin and flexible to 0.8 and hard, you get a selection."
1,5,Perfect to try different sizes and shapes!! great quality. Buy it if you don't know which size or shape will work best for you.
1,5,"Terrific way to tray out various picks without committing to a whole pack of something you might not end up liking.  And high praise for GO-DPS Music.  These guys had the product out the door the same day I ordered it, sent some great sale information on other gear, and included a catalog explaining the specs of all the picks I'd ordered.  I only spent 1.99 and I really felt like they went out of their way to earn more of my business - which they did!"
1,4,"Couldn't be happier than playing with a variety of picks - each one has a different feel and sound. The dura picks have more variety, there's only one in each thickness. The celluloid ones come two per size. As a pick, I liked using all of them, from the super floppy thinnest dura to the hard plastic thickest celluloid. Worth getting even if just to experiment - some of the picks were easier to use for certain songs than others, and the different thicknesses definitely have a different sound. Similar thickness picks of both material sounded the same but felt different to the fingers."
1,5,A fine inexpensive assortment of thicknesses for the beginning guitarist to choose from.A great deal for a nominal amount of money.
1,5,"just what you see. A good variety of different picks. I got it for me and my dad. My dad plays guitar, and he likes the thinner onnes"
1,5,Great price for 12 picks spanning from light - heavy.Picks are good quality and would recommend to anyone looking for picks.
1,5,"After taking my guitar lessons...I never knew there were soooo many kinds of flexibility or thickness of picks for guitars. My instructor told me that I need a variety to see which one or two felt good in my strumming hand, and to see if I could pick out some melody's without too much problem. I realize the pick is not magical that it plays with out me doing the work, and I have been having fun trying all sorts of sizes, flexibilities, and strengths. Just go for the gusto and find what you like!"
1,5,great value
1,4,"If you are picky these are all eye candy... nice flexible, easy to hold and I received on time at a great price."
1,4,"Throw this right in my little storage bag I use for my gigging materials...microphones, cables, straps, tuner, etc. folds up easy, fits great. Seems stable enough."
1,5,"My classical guitar stand was metal and short, like this, but did not have the front brace or download slant. If I had this then my beloved flamenco guitar might not have tipped over and broken it's headstock on the hard flood. So sad. I mourn it still."
1,4,"Solid, and super easy to use. The best for the price I supposeGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand"
1,5,"You have just simply got to try this little guitar stand.  It folds up so small, and yet remains very stable in use.  Adjustable in a snap, but if you even forget that, it will grip your instrument better than a metal stand.  Anything can be knocked over, but this really works better than you might believe.  Goood !"
1,5,"I bought the wall mounts for a more permanent solution, but this lightweight little stand is sturdy and adjustable. I just move it around the house wherever I feel like playing. Fold it up to take with me when I go out of town. Everyone who sees it loves it."
1,5,"I love the Hola! small instrument stand. It is sturdy and folds up nicely for me to take with me when I go to the Ukulele Club. It has a nice rubber padding so I trust putting my instrument on it. I have a Tenor Ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand. It is very lightweight which is also a plus. I use the stand at home too. I stand my ukulele on it because sometimes I play and then I want to go to YouTube to listen to a particular song. It is very convenient.  I have recommended this stand to others also.Features I like: lightweight, sturdy and folds up easily."
0,3,"Pros:-Sturdier than expected-Moving parts are all smooth and do not feel like they will deteriorateCons:-If you want to keep the shoulder rest on a violin, it *almost* fits on this stand."
1,5,"I've been able to purchase 5 of these in different sizes for all my pickin' pals.  Lightweight, easy to transport in the back of your amp, or just put it in a bag with your music.  THESE are good values for the money, and do not fall over easily.  Those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work.  I mean really work well too.  Not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas, but otherwise.  They are the BOMB !  whee"
1,5,This is a great portable uke stand to have with you.  It folds up small and will fit in the outside pocket on your uke gig bag.  Having this stand is a lot better than just laying your uke on the floor.
1,5,"This stand is small, compact, and sturdy.  It holds my tenor uke just fine, and when folded, fits into the pocket of my uke case.  It's perfect to take along to a gig or practice, and therefore have a safe place to put the uke down."
1,5,"This stand holds up my ukulele, so yay. Folded up, it fits perfectly inside the side pocket in the Hola gig bag, which I also use and heartily recommend. Make no mistake - this stand is not pretty, it feels and looks like cheap plastic, but it does the job."
1,5,"This is a modeling amp.  IT has several presets, to emulate different sounds.  They factory settings for these are pretty good, and all but the first bank (of three) can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp.  If you get the fender fuse software (license comes with the amp) you can get some pretty amazing &#34;pre&#34; sets from fender and other users.This is not a massive cabinet, so you aren't going to get that &#34;big&#34; a sound, regardless. But for a small room it's great!Common complaint I have seen:  No clean channel/preset.This is not the case.  There are a couple of factory presets that are &#34;clean&#34; although some people want cleaner.  You can either adjust the gain/vol yourself or download one of several VERY nice very clean presets from the fender forums.  That said, one of my guitars is edgy, it wants to overdrive the amp.  Another doesn't, and is very clean, even on the factory preset clean.I very nearly got a different amp.  I went to a music store and a salesman showed me a Mustang II.  I was sold when he showed me what all it could do - then showed me the price for a Mustang I!!  For ~$100 USD this is about as much as you could possibly ask for.It'll keep me busy for a long time."
1,5,"I bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar. There is so much debate out there about amps vs solid state (this is a solid state). People will make ridiculous claims if you choose not to purchase a $400 tube amp to practice through. (&#34;You're not getting the right tone, man....&#34; The problem with that is, there are several companies out there Marshall, Fender, Vox, Orange, etc....and they all have a variety of tube amps to choose from and they all begin in price around this one. So, I figured, before I committed to a company, maybe I could just use this Fender to emulate some of those sounds I want.That worked out beautifully. Though I am very much a beginner, I have a greater appreciation for the nuances an amp's eq can have on your guitar's tone. I thought I needed pedals to have some of these effects, instead I can just change the channel to a preset and there is all the flanger/reverb/modulation I need. I have got to the point where I understand about how just adjusting my volume/switching pickups and using the built in guitar knobs can alter my tone enough to stand out when I want to.I would not have been able to do that without this amp. This amp helped me develop as a beginner so I wouldn't waste money buying other things, beginners think they should get. Excellent amp and I recommend getting this over the Mustang II. Save the difference for your real amp that will come when you actually know a little more."
1,4,"I bought this along with a new guitar for my daughter, as she is learning to play. My son has also joined in the fun. This is a pretty complex amp, and will require quite a bit of time to figure out everything that it can do. It can be a little daunting for a newbie."
1,5,"My first review was a knee-jerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it.  I couldn't get it to sound like I wanted it to.....I WAS SO WRONG IN GIVING IT ONLY 2 STARS...I must now rerate it with a 5 star.  This amp does almost too much for the money.  My only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has.  It can do ANYTHING and sound any way you want it too.WOW, I never knew my guitar could sound like this.  It actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have.  I am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite Amp when I totally figure it out, if I ever do.  The sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settings.So, in short, forgive me as I have sinned and judged too early.  BUY this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it.  If you are looking for a small, plug and play amp...this isn't it.  But it you're looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities. this IS it.  It is growing on me and I wouldn't part with it now."
1,4,"Luv it, I had version #1 and this amp isnt much different.they both are cheap and sound great plus u can connect to the computer software"
1,5,"Do not expect this to sound like a Fender Frontman with 2 x 12"" speakers. But for practicing in your bedroom or similar it's perfect. Plenty of sound effects to mess around with. Are they as good as dedicated $100 per stomp box effects? Probably not, but so what. Just found out the best part of this amp. You can connect it via the USB port to your PC not only for using the rather cheesy Fender software, but it lets you pipe your guitar's sounds into software like Garage Band. You can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an M-Audio M-Track or similar. PS: It is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the MIC or LINE IN in of your computer (even with the right adapter plugs) as the impedances will not be right. On top of that, I have connected the Mac's headphone audio out to the amp's AUX in! Sounds MUCH better than listening to the PC's normal puny speakers.UPDATE: While the built in USB interface does work, a dedicated device with good pre-amps like the Focusrite 2i2 is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer.UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: While I am keeping this amp for convenience I have quickly learned that NOTHING can match a real tube amp. You can simulate all you want (and I am talking much more expensive SW solutions, its like imitation chocolate vs. REAL chocolate. Got the Marshall DSL 40 Watt combo. Amazing sound."
1,5,"Works very well and is portable.  Guitar leans pretty far back, but I 'put a sock on it', no literally, and now the guitar leans at the right angle.  Not literally a right angle, but a very good angle.  Why do you have to be so difficult?"
1,5,"I've tried numerous stands for the variety of instruments I use: electric guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin, violin, and banjo. This one fits all of them and holds them securely and folds up easily for transport. It doesn't get in the way, has rubber feet and padding, and just works simply and effectively. It's not flashy looking, but then it's never seen because it either is hidden by the instrument, or blends in because of its compact size and black color. Nothing else is as versatile and effective, including the multi instrument stands, the ones with other shapes of the support arms, and other folding designs. This is simply the ideal."
1,4,"works as advertised, good construction, folds easy, holds acoustic or electric, does not nock over easy or at all.  good product"
1,5,"What a great A-frame stand, especially for the money. It's lightweight but super-stable. I like it so much that I ordered three more. All 7 of my electric guitars fit wonderfully onto the stand, as do my acoustics. The similarly-priced Fender is a FPOS. It leans WAYYY too far back.I couldn't have hoped for more from these stands. Buy one. Buy a couple."
0,2,"The concept of this guitar stand is great, and I thought it would be perfect for my two Telecasters...That is until I get the stands in place and put the guitars in them. The stands have a very deep angle, and from what I could tell, the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees back.It just looks silly, like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand, or are in a slow-motion fall backwards. It also ends up taking up WAY too much space, as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes. I ended up returning these stands, but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version."
1,5,It has a nice solid construction and a sturdy stance. Yet it folds flat to provide storage capability in a minimum of space.
1,5,This stand is sturdy and my guitars &#34;seat&#34; like an anchor.  I use one for my electric and another for acoustic.  Will be getting another as soon as I get daughters new guitar.
1,5,"This guitar stand is as basic as you can get.Has padding where it needs it to protect guitar.Sets up in seconds.Provides good stability and displays guitar nicely.Perfect stand as long as you don't have others(roomates,kids,pets,etc.,who may bump it and knock it over)."
0,2,Cheap. The best way to describe this stand. It serves it's purpose but spend a few shekels more on a better guitar stand.
1,5,"Works great, does what it should, holds all my guitars securely.  acoustic and electric, but not at the same time.  haha"
1,5,I cold not believe how much more sturdy my guitar is in this stand. I had the typical guitar stand before and had to be very careful about it tipping over. This one is so secure and my guitar has never felt like it would tip over. Small and sturdy. I use it at practice and during our live shows. You can't go wrong with this.
1,4,"I like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily. The biggest down side is the angle that the guitar sits, the lean is to far back so you'll need to keep it further from walls than usual. Other wise good deal."
1,5,"I bought 3 of these and will by more for my guitar collection. Cheap but work. Nothing fancy...just functional. Nothing more to say, but it said I needed 1 more word."
1,5,I needed an inexpensive music stand for my guitar lessons. This worked well for that.
1,5,"YES, DEAR READER, THIS STAND WILL WORK AS A GOOD SUPPORT STAND FOR NOT ONLY MY GRAND CONCERT SIZE ACOUSTIC GUITAR, FOR  MY FIVE- STRING BANJO (WITH RESONATOR), AND.ALSO  FOR MY BARITONE UKULELE.  THE STAND IS.STURDY, PROVIDES GOOD SUPPORT, AND LOOKS GOOD.  I AM PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE. AND WILL PROBABLY BUY ANOTHER JUST LIKE IT FOR MY BANJO. THE PACKAGE ARRIVED IN TIME AND WAS PROTECTED BY AN ADEQUATE SHIPPING CONTAINER.."
1,5,Not much to really say but its a great stand that is durable and i have no problems with it and it does not scratch your guitar.
0,3,"Just barely gets the job done...I have a Fender Jazz Bass Standard.  The shape of the body of the guitar does not fit the arms of this stand and it forces you to position it very carefully to avoid the stand collapsing.  It is very low quality, not particularly sturdy and my cords get wrapped around it constantly.  Its JUST good enough, but if my room were larger and my guitar out in the open, I would be constantly worried about it falling over.  I will definitely be replacing this with a better quality stand in the near future."
1,5,"The stand works great. It supports my Casio CTK6250 on the shortest level and can go pretty high as well. This thing folds up so it is easy for storing. It is a bit heavy, but that allows it to support almost any keyboard. This is by far the most stable keyboard stand out there and a great price too."
1,4,"Not the best but not the worse. This stand works as expected, it can hold a guitar. All the surfaces that make contact with your instrument are covered with rubber padding which is important. Only downside is there's no neck support. I used this mainly for putting my guitar down when not playing not for displaying!"
1,5,"Simple to deploy and holds the guitar very effectively. Good value. Low to the ground, so balance is not an issue."
1,5,"Inexpensive and practical. You don't have to watch out too much when placing a guitar on this - just about any angle will work. Needs little space, another plus."
1,5,"I received a MIM Stratocaster as a gift a year ago. Recently, I noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp. After tracing the issue, I discovered there was some play in the Strat's jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip. A quick fix was to bend the jack's connector end, but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open, making a minor gap where there wasn't that positive connection.I've purchased several Switchcraft jacks and they just work. Stronger, more flexible metal, easy soldering, good materials. It's a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection. Obviously, because the finish is chromed, oxidation can get in the way of the connection, but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied. If oxidation/wear is an issue, Switchcraft makes gold-plated jacks. However, I just love these jacks, and for the price, they really can't be beat."
1,5,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! THE SAME AS THE OLD ONE I GOT IN MY BC RICH WARLOCK NETCK TRU
1,5,"What really can you say about Switchcraft, they just make good solid parts.  Grab one, drop it in and replace that old broken import jack."
1,5,"Bought this as a replacement for a vintage guitar I am re-doing.  I've learned the hard way that there are some things you don't skimp on.  And this is one.  Switchcraft is what we used in the Air Force 40 years ago, and are still some of the best-made electronic components out there!"
1,5,I didnt have any issue with this when I went to put it in my strat build. Not a lot to say about it really. Its metal and it works. Switchcraft is usually a good product.
0,3,"It's smaller than i thought, it works fine and it picks the string really fast. It does only tune in the regular A tune (so E, A, D, G, B, E). So since it's a gift for my father in law it works just fine, but since I use a A flat tuning for my Gibson, and even lower (G) for my Jackson it doesn't work for me."
1,5,This a great chromatic clip on guitar tuner.  The letters are big so you don't have to strain your eyes to see the notes when you tune.  Clips easily to your guitar and turns where you can see the letters when tuning.
1,4,"I've been using this for a month or so and it works as described.  Some people rate this above the Snark devices, but I cannot.If I were to choose, I'd go for the Snark but this is still an acceptable tuner."
1,5,I have a few tuners that are somewhat like this GT-1 Clip-on Tuner. However this is the best one I have because of the format of the Clip-on Tuner GT-1. The size of the Clip-on GT-1 one is also great. So far the tuner is very accurate. in conclusion I would like to say that the Clip-on GT-1 is a good quality. However I could have got this product for a lot cheaper!
0,3,"Tuner works well for violins and mandolins especially.  Little harder to read than I would have liked, especially in sunlight.  It would be nice if there was a sound feature.  One other thing that I had in mind, so I'll say it here.  the people that purchase these should put out a Model that Says BLUEGRASS, and this 'blue' tuner would be an even bigger hit."
1,5,"This is one of the best tuner I have had, what a great value for a low cost.  Thank to all for selling this Guitar Tuner at Amazon."
1,5,"Every once and a while I play the bass guitar and while I use the Snark for my guitars, itwill not tune the bass; this tuner does a great job of that task, plus the guitar."
1,5,Great little piece of leather. Does what I want it to do and does not hurt my guitar. Thank you
1,4,"I like using these strap ties far more than I do tying a strap to the neck.  They are a great idea.  I found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap, but eventually got it on.  I have two of these, and I use them.  I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who doesn't like tying on their guitar straps."
1,5,"If you do not want to have a hole drilled in your new Martin guitar, this is a must have product. I didn't want to have a hole drilled in a new Martin guitar, so this worked fine wit the Martin leather straps. Actually I bought two of them..... It is a 5-star product."
1,4,"this is a great item.and works as reported.It seemed to be in my fretting hands way a little,but its ok"
1,4,"I received this yesterday in my order.  It fits on my guitar fine, but I can't seem to get my guitar strap affixed to the head stock strap.  The button is so rounded and smooth, that my guitar strap just won't go over the top of the button.  Not sure what to do now."
1,5,This is an attractive leather head stock strap.  The leather is very soft and flexible. I would love to have an entire guitar strap made from the same leather.
1,5,"I have other capos and decided to try this one, and I have to say I love it! I have used the Kyser (spelling?) for years as my favorite, and that is a good capo - but I will say that this one is more sturdy and seems to be even stronger on the strings with no buzz. I will have to update this in a few months to see how it holds up - but I love it so far.I use it on my Taylor 910ce, Taylor 718e and my Epiphone Anniv accoustic."
1,5,"I bought this due to the constant problem of getting that awful out-of-tune twang with my previous Planet Waves capo when I would try to reset the capo on a different fret.  Planet Waves capos are awesome, don't get me wrong but this one is specialized for acoustic and works wonderfully."
1,5,"First let's get the easy stuff done with.  This capo is beautiful,  It is clean with an even silver matte finish that looks good in the box (nice packaging) and equally good on the guitar.The capo is solid, the spring mechanism feels good in the hand and when it clamps down on the neck you can see (and hear) there was thought put into the capo to make sure the pressure on the string is even and the neck is well protected. No sharp points to damage the guitar.  And this thing is easy to use, squeeze, put on neck, done.  You could easily move this during a gig and then store it on the edge of your neck when not using it.  I tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both.  When playing the strings behave as normal.  No odd muting or dropouts.  The capo is solid on the neck.I have to say I have not used a capo in a while because the one I have is pain.  With this new capo I am happy to use it.  This thing is great!  Easy to use, efficient, sturdy, looks nice and SOUNDS GREAT!"
1,5,"Good spring action, made pretty solid. No buzzing on the strings when I put it on. The lifetime warranty is what I am stoked about I will probably buy two more for my other guitars. Highly recommend it."
1,5,"Fit perfect to my Taylor T5 and no cons I can find so far. If you want a capo for guitar, this one is the one stop shopping for you."
0,3,"I received these TASCAM headphones as part of the Amazon Vine review program.  I was excited to receive them, as I've looked at them many times and considered ordering due to the reasonable price point and 'professional grade' designation.I'm not an audiophile, nor am I snob about audio devices.  Any brand that works well at the right price, I'll buy it.  That being said, I've recently been fortunate enough to get to try out lots of headphones, with theBose AE2w Bluetooth Headphones - Blackbeing the most recent.Obviously the Bose beat the TASCAM ones, so it would be unfair to compare them other than to say that 'sound wise' you can really tell a difference in the mid and high range.  These TASCAM TH-2000-R 'Professional Grade' Headphones don't sound clear to me in the mid and high ranges.  Bass is great, but even when tweaking the equalizer settings I never could find the clarity I was seeking in the full range.I listened to several genres: Classical, Blues, Pop, Rock, Electronic, Country, and Latino with these headphones.  Each time, the quality was good, but not great despite attempted software and device adjustments on my iPhone, PC andYamaha RX-V675 7.2 Channel Network 3D AV Receiver with Airplay (Black).The fit of the headphones is big for me.  Usually, they are too small.  Having them as small as I could make them (top of my head to ears), the cups still dropped down a bit lower than I liked. I had to hold them in place to get a solid fit.  The padding underneath the headpiece is minimal, and after about 15 minutes of use the top of my head hurt.The build quality of these phones appears to be excellent. The cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6'.  The screw on adapter: 1/8(3.5mm) to 1/4(6.3mm) allows for use with multiple devices, stereo components and sound boards.  The foldable design does allow for some size reduction, but not much.These headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass.  Great for those who want the chunky headset look, are on the go DJing, and/or have larger heads.They are not for those looking for a wide range and subtlety in their listening.  They're also not for those with smaller heads."
1,4,"These headphones are almost perfect. The sound is great, good balance between highs and lows. They are comfortable too as far as ear pads go. The only problem is the size. These are for people with big heads, or who wear headphones over a hat, or who are buying headphones for their pet grizzly bear. Maybe all the people at Tascam have really big heads. Mine is average, and these slide down because the headband is too large even at the smallest setting. So minus one star for that. Otherwise, sound quality is excellent. Comes with a 1/4 inch adapter, which is nice. Good price."
1,5,"To describe my impressions of the TH-2000-S versus my well-used Sennheiser HD-201s I chose a few favorite reference tracks that illustrate different instrumental timbres and production values:  I like to use recordings I know well so I can quickly detect varying emphasis in frequency response and clarity.Andres Segovia - `Variations on a Spanish Folk Tune - Narvaez' from `My Favorite Spanish Encores'.In my opinion one of the finest recordings of solo classical guitar I've ever heard, both for the performance and the sheer beauty of sound.  The distinguishing points of this opening piece are the bass notes that Segovia's arrangement of the original vihuela-texture really emphasize. For me there's a difference between bass presence and bass clarity: I'll gladly trade less `oomph' in the gut for the kind of definition the Tascam's bring out:  warm, well-defined, with a crisp and clear treble edge. The Sennheisers, while equally balanced, were far muddier and less defined at the low end with less presence and sparkle on top. They were also considerably quieter and this applies across the board - the TH-2000-S just puts out a lot more sound at similar volume settings.Jeff Beck `You Know What I Mean' from `Blow By Blow'.The George Martin production remains for me one of the most colorful instrumental electric guitar records ever made.  The clean separation and space in the mix between guitar, electric piano, clavinet, bass and drums is always a joy to hear on a good sound system. The TH-2000s again demonstrated more punch in the mids and bottom end than the Sennheisers and overall more presence. It's a 24-bit recording and this is the first time I can honestly say I hear the difference - like being there in the control room, seriously. There's a greyness to the Sennheisers that frankly never bothered me before, but after hearing the Tascam phones, I doubt I'll ever be satisfied with less again.Stravinsky Violin Concerto - Anne Sophie Mutter from `Mutter Modern'.The words I keep coming back to are `presence' and `clarity'. I can hear string attacks, counter voices in woodwinds and an increase in overall spaciousness with the TH-2000-S that I simply don't hear with the Sennheiser phones.As far as craftsmanship, the TH-2000-S weighs more than my other phones and much of that weight is in the band rather than the cups. The sliding cup adjustment is easy to move yet ratcheted to stay in place securely when removing the phones casually. The cup mounts are really well-designed and allow fine-grained 4-way rotation that guarantees a snug fit regardless of the size and shape of your head and ears. I like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head. The 2-3"" cushion along the inside of the band and in particular the adds comfort.The cord is a hybrid - the 2-3' closest to the phones is flat 1/8"" diameter, well-insulated 'matte-finish' and flexible. Beyond that there's another foot of coiled wire that will comfortably expand another 3-4 feet.  I think it's a nice compromise that's probably biased towards most users sitting fairly close to an output jack - you can avoid having to deal with excess cord unless you need to.As we get older our hearing changes: for most people it's a decrease in high-frequency response but it also occur across the entire spectrum.  Simply listening louder isn't always the best solution and it can be a tremendous ear-opening experience to try a pair of better quality headphones. I'd encourage anyone excited by quality sound to experiment and these Tascam TH-2000-S are a good place to start."
0,2,"The TASCAM TH-2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears! They are great! Excellent bass response (not muddy at all), tight mids, and clear highs. To boot, they are extremely comfortable as well. The foam fits nicely around your ears, conforming to the contours of your face. They are adjustable, so if you have a huge head you can still wear these. The only drawback that I can see, and I don't really even consider this a negative, is the coiled cord. Some people may not like that. All in all these are great headphones - I have listened to all varieties of music with them, monitored recordings with them, etc... excellent! By the way, they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background, making the music come out clearer. Kudos to Tascam for making such good headphones!May 12, 2014 UPDATE ------These headphones quit working after just a few months of working properly. I have a couple pair of inexpensive behringers that have lasted through more abuse and are still working. What a disappointment!!!"
0,3,"These headphones really seem to be built pretty well, so it is with some regret that I have to report that I don't like them.The sound reproduction is not flat, and it has a distinct bass heaviness that I can't use when recording or mixing.  In addition to the bass-heavy delivery, there seems to be a dip in the upper mids, a boost in the low mids, and a rolling off of the high end.  This just doesn't work for me in the studio.  The overall size of the headphones is large and they won't fit well for people with smaller heads.  I had some people try them on and they all stated that the earpieces went down too far and didn't fit on their ears properly.  I checked to make sure that they were retracted to their smallest size and they were.This is a shame, as TASCAM make some fine products and are a good name.  I have owned four DA-88 recorders, many field recorders, and three different portable recorders from them, all of which have been great. I am certainly not saying anything bad about the company, but their headphones are just put out there to be low-priced headphones that are not suited to a professional studio.I have used theSony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone [Electronics] for decades now and I still recommend them.  I have had the same pairs for over 20 years and they are all still going strong, barring replacing the ear padding.  The Sony headphones do not cost a tremendous amount more, and they are worth every penny if you are doing studio work.I would also recommend theAKG K 240 MK II Stereo Studio HeadphonesorAKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphonesover the TASCAM reviewed here.  The AKG perform much better when you are using a headphone amplifier though, so that would need to be taken into account."
1,4,"I was doubtful this would work but it will give you a fairly accurate reading of all six strings at once.  I do like that the volume is reduced when you switch it on.  The only issue I have noticed is that some strings it will read as slightly out of tune (1 red bar) but when you go to individually tune it you sometimes fine it is not flat.  So for me it is a quick check while I am in between songs, anything with 2 bars or more will get more attention."
1,5,"This thing rocks! Best quality than polytune  1, lighter and best switch. Brighter screen. Simply the best for fast tuning"
1,5,"I had just purchased a Polytune about 6 months to 1 year ago, and was a little annoyed when I saw ads for the Polytune 2.  Mine was still brand new to me and worked really well.  But after reading and watching about the improvements in this update I decided to take the hit, sell mine for a loss of $20 and get the new one.  A GREAT choice.  This Polytune 2 is amazing - bright, accurate (strobe option), well built...did I say bright?...improved foot switch... It's just another example of TC hitting it out of the park yet again.  Highly recommend getting one of these, you know, unless you want to grab a 1st gen for a deal... ;)"
0,3,I personally went with the pitch black pedal tuner. The reason why is the LED lights on these guys are small and harder to see onstage. The pitch black is nice and bold and bright. One reason why i almost got this thought is the ability to tune all strings at the same time. So its a give and take issue.
1,5,"This pedal is great help on stage. It's fast and accurate, and with polytune &#34;option&#34; you can easily find which string is out of tune."
1,5,"First off this is a overdrive pedal with a MOSFET circuit engineered to sound like overdriven tube distortion. The pedal is very good at this. There are a lot of tones available but fully cranked through a large amp, this is on par with the warm tone of another EHX pedal, the Big Muff Fuzz. The tone function is kindof useless to me I like to keep it on, With the switch turned on the effect is a little too harsh. Don't let that keep you from checking this hot rod out. I love mine. Its a keeper."
1,5,"This thing is amazing. Love the sound It produces.Well made, like a tank. Real quality.Expect to be using this without any problems for a long long time."
0,3,"Tone is subjective and 3 stars means it just OK to me.  It does need a hot signal going in to sound good, so use a boost in front of it or hot pickups.  The distortion is fuzzy, but not fuzz, almost like a fuzzy static.  The EQ switch that removes the tone circuit causes the pedal to become really dark so I always have the tone in the circuit. I used it with a vintage Vibrolux Reverb. This is not my go to pedal or my go to second pedal.  I am still trying to figure out how to use it so it sounds good to me.  It is made well. For the money I am not mad I tried it."
1,5,"The EXH Hot Tubes compact pedal offers a very unique sound and is difficult to review from an objective standpoint.  I had no knowledge of or experience with the original full-sized Hot Tubes pedal from the late 1970's.  And, frankly, many of the reviews I read online about both the original and the reissue were less than flattering.  I think part of that hatred comes from the fact that you have an analog pedal without actual tubes that claims (both in the name of the device and in the artwork on the casing) to sound like an overdriven tube amplifier.  Really, though, if you think about it, doesn't EVERY overdrive pedal (including the venerable Tubescreamer) make that same claim?When I plugged into the Hot Tubes, I was surprised, but immediately intrigued.  I actually ended up purchasing this over the excellent East River Drive, which was very good, but also a very &#34;familiar&#34; sounding clone of a TS-808.  What the Hot Tubes does is anything but &#34;familiar&#34; from an affordable OD pedal.This pedal has a significant amount of output, and (unlike many other overdrives) it has considerable low end.  In fact, it likely even adds bass to your sound.  There is a tone circuit bypass switch that I do not fully understand.  Basically, with the switch off, there is no tone control, and they advertise this sound as &#34;powerful&#34; and touch-responsive. Since the pedal trends to the darker side of things, however, I actually left it in the &#34;on&#34; position and worked the tone from the 12:00 to 1:30 settings.The gain structure is as bizarre as it is unique, though it actually starts to make sense if you think about how gain responds on an actual vintage tube amp.  From the 7:00 (0%) setting up to around 12:00, your tone basically remains clean, provided you started with a clean signal.  My setup was a Strat into a Fender Super Champ X2, which is a tube/hybrid amp with a great clean &#34;Blackface&#34; setting.  However, the Hot Tubes completely transforms that tone.  That setting on my amp is normally bright with some great upper end chime, but the Hot Tubes offered a thick, smokey tone that was mostly clean, with maybe a bit of muffled grit mixed into it.As you start get past 12:00 on the overdrive knob, the amount of gain increases exponentially.  At this point, the pedal behaves more like an overdrive, though the gain is almost fuzz-like.  Some people have described it as a &#34;Jack White&#34; type of sound, but I'll really leave it to individual users to decide if they &#34;like&#34; it or not.There are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about.  First, I want to make clear that this is a DARK, bassy pedal.  In that respect, it is completely different from the EXH Soul Food and East River Drive, both of which have some measure of bass drop.  The tone circuit only helps to open up the tone a slight bit, but it could do more.  I do not believe this is the type of overdrive you would stack with - it might actually benefit from a brighter overdrive stacking INTO it.  If your rig is already on the dark or muffled side, you may want to stay away from this pedal.  That being said, I would definitely recommend &#34;try before buy&#34; with this one because it is different in hard-to-describe ways.For now, my rating is 5 stars - solid EHX construction, very compact, accessible 9V jack (on the top where it I like it), and a unique overdrive sound at an affordable price that doesn't sound at all like the other overdrives I have.  It certainly won't be for everybody, but so far, I like what I hear."
1,5,"THIS is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest! I've tried dozens of od pedals in the past, (I hate this term) boutiques and non boutiques before I finally stick with SS/BS Mini OD as my always-on pedal cos that thing is a supersonic bad ass since it could cover my needs on clean boost, edge-of-breakup ""clean"" sound, distortion, or even a messed up broken speaker fuzz tonez.. only with your guitar volume knob! (please note that you'll need to have a treble bleed circuit to do this)Okay back to this EHX, I'm kinda tired of messing around with guitar volume knob on the mini so I bought this Hot Tubes as my ""clean"" breakup sound so that I could hit it hard with a cranked up Mini OD. And this, my friend.. JESUS APPROVED! The point is, this pedal's so great and has a great range of dirt.. also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range. It's literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps. I can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeper!PS: Look at the price.. do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal? Just get it, try it, and see if you like it, jeez! :-)"
1,5,"This thing is incredibly cool.  Double the record time of the closest competitor- the TC Ditto- and about twenty bucks cheaper.  Your loop can be as long as 10 minutes, with unlimited over-dubbing.  This pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers- likely due to pre-order obligations and a delayed release.  It was worth the wait.  You can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music.  It's a really cool tool for jamming, performing, or composing.  Operation is simple- press once to record.  Press again and it begins playback.  Press a third time to dub on top of your last layer.  If you make a mistake, press and hold- it will erase your last dub.  Tap twice to stop play of the loop.  Press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing.  Switch is a soft switch, so there is no click.  It is very responsive to pressure.  There is a single knob to control the volume of the loop.  Nicely done, Digitech ;)"
1,5,"At the time of me writing this review, these little guys are hard to find and keep selling out quickly.  I was lucky enough to get my hands on one early.  I almost purchased the very nice Ditto Looper when I started looking for a small and simple looper pedal.  The Ditto is great and should be considered if you are in the market for a tiny looper pedal that does nothing but loop well and at an affordable price.  That said, the Digitech Express XT is a little better.  Both work well but the Digitech has a few more features in almost as small of a foot print.  Here are those features.  The Digitech takes batteries or a power adapter, is cheaper than the Ditto, has 5 more minutes of looping memory, can be daisy chained to other Digitech loopers for multi-tracking and they synch, has LED lights so you know where you are, and it has stereo in/out.  None of these are deal breakers alone but together and currently for 30 bucks less, the Digitech Express XT is the clear winner IMHO if you can find one to buy."
1,4,"Sound quality is great. I also have the very first JamMan with the add on 3 button footswitch.  I wanted a smaller footprint so I purchased this.  Don't expect to run out and use it at a gig without practice though.  In a band setting, your time has to be spot on when you are hitting to record, stop and playback.  Slightly more difficult than the BIG JamMan Looper but very usable.  This blows away the Ditto pedal by another manufacturer......I had that one first and it is horrible to use....sold it.I am happy with it and use it live in a 3 and 4 piece band situation to cover rhythm parts when I am soloing and for harmonized double lead passages.  Excellent quality.  It has a lot of great syncing features but I do not use those.  Find a youtube video to see all of its potential.  Best looper for the money."
1,5,"this is a simple loop effects pedal which makes awesome quality loops and unlimited dubs.  you can jam for hours with this thing, it's awesome."
0,1,"I purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my Roland GR55 (which has a flawless basic looper built in, but only 20 seconds record and no undo). I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along.The factory battery lasted about 1 hour. The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes. I started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9.10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty. The lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc. etc.)The first time I used the JamMan XT (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.I am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so I know it was not my poor technique. The main problem was that it didn't matter how hard I tried (even if I did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start. This makes the unit useless.Also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.The potential for damage here is very high. Also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board. To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read INEVITABLE) damage.I have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.It's going back to the store where I purchased it."
1,5,"remember those little sticky gummi hand things that you used to get out of the quarter machine at the grocery store?Sticky Hands - 12 per unitThese are kinda like that, but a little thicker and shaped into blue rectangles that are approximately 1"" x 2"".you can stick them to any part of your drum head to dampen sound as needed. They even work on cymbals if you're looking for a quicker decay!The closer to the center (or more pads you use), the more dramatic the effect. You can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed. If you drop them or they end up getting too dirty to stick to anything, you can wash them in the sink with dish soap and air dry them.I've been using them for years and they work amazingly!"
0,1,"I really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! They went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a New York Minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage. Save your money. We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now."
1,5,"These really do work well, but it is a difficult struggle to get them separated at 1st. They stick together too well and it is hard to separate them at 1st without ripping the individual pads. I found it a little easier putting them in the fridge over night, then slowly pulling them apart. I also thought about heating them a little or perhaps adding a few drops of water. However chilling them did work well enough. That aside, these will greatly improve the way any set sounds. I've been a pro drummer for over 45 years, and have used masking tape, little cloth squares tapped down, lots of different things. There work best by far and are easily moved around depending on the room you are in and the sound you want. Great stuff. Oh and check out a drum dial to add to your tuning skills. That can help and a great drum doesn't sound so good if it isn't tuned right."
1,5,"I am a guitar player who bought a drum kit for people to jam on when they are at my place. I also bought a lesson book for drums, for myself. I point this out so you know &#34;who&#34; is writing the review; a rookie drummer...I did some research before buying and found most if any negative comments were along the lines of &#34;if you tune your drums properly...these aren't needed&#34;. Well, news flash, I'm not a freaking drummer or expert drum technician with years of experience. I can tune them half decent with the torque tuner I bought (Rhythm Tech RT 7350 ) but there are several drums that still had overtones or prolonged sustain that I did not like in my tiny jam room.This moongel was so simple to apply it is a crime and I just moved them around a little to get them in a position that was both out of the way and killed the resonation I wasnt liking. So what's not to like? I love it!Cost wise, Amazon was a few $$ more than the local GC but then again, it was quick and simple.I liked it so much I bought a second."
1,5,"these work better than anything else I ever used to muffle drums and get out all those annoying overtones while recording, think this product came from outer space because man could not make a product so great that is so cheap that works so well."
1,4,I seem to have problem with getting it to &#34;hear&#34; low E (of all strings) but it is very compact and convenient to use.
0,3,I love these clip-on tuners. I have several but this is the first one I purchased that is a bit of a pain because there is not angle adjustment for viewing it easily. I have to move the guitar neck to see it right and that makes it inconvenient.
1,5,"Added December 5:Has yet to fall off the fiddle scroll again so the 5 star rating stands without an asterisk.Added November 8:I put the star back.  I've got (another) one on one of my banjos.  It does require a teeny bit of twisting a neck (either mine or the banjo's!) to see it clearly, but the size is more convenient if you want to carry it in your pocket and there's no neck to snap.While it may have some trouble staying affixed to a fiddle's scroll, it seems firmly rooted to the banjo's headstock.-------------------------Original November 4:This tuner has a display like the SN-8 rather than the SN-1 after which it is named. It's like any other Snark Super tight Tuner.I've taken off 1 star for two reasons:(1) I find I have to twist either my neck or my instrument uncomfortably to use it. Maybe it's just a matter of finding the right place to put it.  I'll keep trying.(2) My music partner immediately adopted it for her fiddle thinking she could leave it on all the time.  It was clamped solidly on the scroll but, to do that and have it be comfortable to read, the tuner was hanging down while playing.  Eventually it slipped off.  If it weren't kept on, this wouldn't be an issue, but that's how the advertising shows the tuner being used--clamped to a guitar headstock, hanging down. I'll report back if it doesn't happen again for a while. Even if this *is* an issue, its small square shape makes it very easy to slip into a pocket while not in use, so I still think it's worth 4 stars."
0,2,The larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so I thought this might be the answer.  The answer is to treat your larger Snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesn't cut it.  I have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display.  I'm quite disappointed and it sits here with no use.  It is cheap though.  Still to me it was money out the window.
1,5,"I've purchased many Snark tuners. For my young guitar students, they are the easiest for them to use. Very stable and they make tuning a joy.This new Snark is compact and is also fast, stable and easy to read. My one problem is the angle the viewing screen is in use. I have to bend my neck far back of the guitar to see it. They need to rethink the design.But overall, I like it. I'll still keep my older Snarks and continue to use this one as well."
1,4,"The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is that I've noticed it's response is a little less than the original (bulky) Snark SN-1. I must admit I haven't checked out a new battery, as with my original Snark, a new battery made a big difference. But the size is something that cannot be beat (the original Snark is a little ungainly) and this tuner really fits beautifully on my Strat. I have a Boss Tu-2 stompbox tuner and am thinking of freeing up my pedal board real estate and using this instead.Overall, this is a definite buy."
1,5,This thing is TINY and does not have the breakable swivel head of the original snark. This is the only tuner you need!
1,5,"This works well.  Has nice ergonomics, fits all of my acoustic guitars, and is easy to use.  No adjustments are required for my guitars, but it is nice to know that the options is available for this capo.This capo comes with a pick holder.  And, it is expandable with aD'Addario NS Micro Clip-On Tunerthat attaches onto the lower arm.  I do not use a pick, and I use my own tuners, so neither of these two features is applicable for my needs.This capo has moved up as one of two highly used capos for my guitars, the other one being theG7th Performance Capo.  The G7 capo goes with my Takamine New Yorker, and this Planet Waves goes on everything else.  If anyone needs to use a capo, I loan out myKyser Capo.Recommended."
1,5,"I have the original version of this capo and it works just fine as does this one.  However, it seems theu have made a slight modification which increases its value from my viewpoint.  Yhey have added a channel on the capo onto which slides a bracket which is included.  This bracket holds the NS micro tuner, of which I have 3.  I had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications.  However, now, this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need.  A simple modification, but bordering on genius.  The capo itdelf id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screw/spring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed.  Highly recommended."
1,5,"I have been playing guitar for more years than I care to admit. Okay I bought a 1966 Telecaster brand new back then. Still have it and love it. I have a lot of different guitars, mostly electric, and 4 acoustics. On my electrics I love extra light 8 gauge strings. (Only about 5% of us do) I can fly on those and do things at a pace this is a lot more difficult with heavier gauge strings. Anyhow I digress, but for a reason. Light gauge strings are subject to tuning problems if you have big fat frets like the .050&#34; found on Gibons and ESP-LTD's. When you squeeze the string to fret it, with light gauge strings it is all too easy to squeeze it all the way to the fret board. With X-Large jumbo frets that can be quite a distance making the guitar go out of tune. The cure for that is using heavier gauge strings such as 10's or more so it makes it possible to determine quite easily just where the top of the fret is without doing the full squeeze all the way to the fret board. So most capo's work with 10's and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings. So a lot of capos can create a comfortable fit fully fretting the strings without them going into the sharp note zone.So since I use lighter gauge strings, and even 9's are subject to the same limitation, I have had a hard time finding a capo that would sit comfortably at the top of the range between the fret and the board, and still squeeze the string sufficiently so as to not create any buzz and do so without making the string too sharp. Guess what? Now I found it. I have several capos and none of them make the grade for light gauge strings except this one. To be honest with you I was surprised when it worked.Okay so here is how I put it to the test. I used the Snark headstock tuner which is a great little tuner if you know the secret to using it. I also have the Peterson HD tuner bench model which is fodder for another post with its one tenth of one cent tuning accuracy. Okay back to the explanation.With the Snark you tune the open string until the line stays in the center without wavering off to one side. The only problem is that most any headstock tuner I have seen they aren't superbly accurate. (The Peterson headstock tuner I sent back because it was acting crazy. Anyhow...) So the secret to using the Snark which I like best out of the headstock tuners I have tried is to tune the open string first, and then fret the string on let's say the 5th fret. You will occasionally find that a string in the open position registers as being in tune, even though it may be a little sharp, or a little flat, so when you strum the whole chord you will get a desire to tune it, so your ears can hear it, in order to get it spot on. There is nothing more beautiful than a perfectly tuned guitar, and nothing worse than one that is well out of tune.So by tuning the open string, and then tuning the fretted string, once both are in tune it is right on. So in the open position if by chance it is a tiny bit sharp, not enough to register on the tuner, when you fret that string, for example on the 5th fret that naturally stretches the string a little bit, making it sharper, which will now show on the Snark as a note that is too sharp. Once you balance the open string, and the fretted string you really have a wonderfully tuned instrument. You don't even need to hear it. So your audience is not listening to you tune up, yet you get it right in the sweet spot that we all love and know so well.So with that being said you can more fully understand why this D'Addario NS Artist Capo is the cat&#8217;s meow. It is the first tuner that I ever used that kept the guitar perfectly in tune after clamping it on the neck. (It is adjustable like the others are, but this one is sensitive for light gauge strings as well)You often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting on the capo; not with this one even with light gauge strings. I must admit I was surprised taking it right out of the wrapper, after going through the above tuning procedure to get the guitar spot on, that it immediately did the job just right. It wasn't even a little bit sharp.To be super critical here is another tip. When using this capo put it closer to the fret, rather than in the middle between two frets. For some reason it stretches the string less in doing so. It has to do with the tension resistance at a steeper angle right alongside of a fret, rather than farther way like in the middle between the two frets. I did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets. (With 8 gauge strings)Since the two most important factors are that it is comfortable to use, not getting in the way when playing open chords and keeping the guitar in tune. The best way to use this capo is to simply clamp the strings right above the second fret for example, rather than right below the third one. Right below the third one gives you that perfect tune also, just like right above the second one does, but it keeps the capo way out of your way. As a matter of fact I am so accustomed to using the capo position to know where to finger the chords, that I sometimes make a mistake and fret them one lower than they belong. With a little practice, or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that. To say this quite simply is to say use this capo farther away from your hand. You just slide it down to being right above the fret below it, rather than right below the fret above it.So there it is. This Capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp. Of course if it can accurately handle 8's it will breeze through anything thicker. Out of the box it is set at its lightest setting, and that is perfect for 8's on the Telecaster I tried it on. Teles and Strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks. So it will work the same with both.So I guess I can't recommend this capo high enough since it is the ONLY one that works perfectly with super light gauge strings. My only problem is being sure to remember which guitar case it is in so I can switch it over when using a different guitar. I might get another one for a backup."
0,3,"I completely agree with &#34;JPfromOH&#34;.This Planet Waves D'Addario Artist Capo tries to be too many things and winds up doing none of them perfectly.The micro-adjusting knob for tweaking tension/pressure is nice, but I've wound up having to mess about with it repeatedly with every guitar/ukulele that I have.  (A standard tension spring might be a bit too firm, but at least it's consistent.)I also thought I'd like the curved cradle for the neck, but it winds up pushing the capo to odd positions on one of my guitars and makes it very uncomfortable to play with on my tenor ukulele. I know, I know, this isn't designed for ukuleles, but I have no such troubles with my Kyser capos.I don't understand the clip for a tuner on this thing.  I have several clip-on tuners that clip directly to the headstock. (And most are Planet Waves already!)  Why would I want to purchase a separate tuner that can only be used when I'm using the capo?  I suppose that if you have money to burn, this is a useful addition.And the pick holder is a nice touch, but... I use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me.As others have noted, there are other, better capos out there."
1,5,For years I used Kyser capos and the handle for them always sticks out and that can be an issue. Planet Waves' NS has a smoother handle that doesn't stick out as much and i've had no issues with gripping it on or off so far. It is easy to put on and off and it holds the strings down properly. If you're looking to buy a capo i'd recommend this over a Kyser.
0,2,"The tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo I've ever used - and I've tried many over the years. But what was Ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem, including the pick clip and tuner holder, protude outward away from the fingerboard? It's awkward to apply and remove quickly. It's visually distracting for player and audience, and it doesn't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.The only possible justification I can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck -  but even that doesn't fly. Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and, unless you're avoiding playing that first fret (or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position) you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand. I own the older Planet Waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.Otherwise the construction of the NS Artist Capo is superb. The surface is arched, probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various Strat fingerboards as well as a flatter SG/LP style. It doesn't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1 which is virtually the same as a classical. If I cranked the tension it's possible the rubber would flatten out but I wouldn't risk marring the neck wood.I tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional, but to be honest I wouldn't use either - too distracting and I only use tuners to get an initial A, then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments, depending on what they are.The only other capo I've ever used that protudes outward is the Kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence' design. I have one and, as good as the holding action is, I've never felt comfortable with the design. The older Planet Waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.To top off the confusion, the picture on the front of the cardboard card the NS Artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo!"
1,5,"I own several capos, but this is the first with an adjustable tension.  Several of my acoustic and electrics have different types of curvatures in the neck.  I picked out a couple and selected one of my other capos to match play against the NS Artist. There wasn't a whole log of tonal differences near the nut when I compared the capos, but when I compared them from the 5th fret on...there was some slight noticeable differences.  Granted, I had to readjust the tension on the NS Artist. Why readjust?  The neck's character changes slightly as you get nearer the body, and to ensure that I had just enough and not too much tension (after all that's why it's adjustable), I readjusted the tension.  The tonal differences were more noticeable when I played softly, and less when I cranked down.  All in all...not a bad capo."
0,2,"I am a fan of Planet Waves NS capos, but this new one is not very well designed. The way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards. I find my left hand hitting the lever when I'm in open position. Frustrating. It does have a pick holder, which can be handy, and a place to put an NS tuner, which can also be handy. I just think it could have been better designed. I don't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff. I'll stick to my other NS Planet Waves capo or my old faithful Kyser."
1,4,"This is one of the nicer capo's Ive used.  Certainly superior to the old school band-based jobs from yesteryear.  One of the nicest features is it can be clipped on the head while not in use and then you can quickly grab, position, release and go.  Heck, you could probably place it mid-song if you were so inclined to do so.Also it clamps without bending the strings.I've used it on my Start, Les Paul and Martin all with no complaints. I hardly ever use a capo, but if I need one, I am glad to have this one."
1,5,"I own Dunlop, Kyser and G7th Nashville Capos.  I don't like the direction the Dunlop faces, it seems awkward.  The Kyser spring is very poplar, but I think the spring tension is too strong, making it harder to take on and off and I think it makes the strings a little sharp.  I like the G7th Nashville Capo, but the spring tension is inconsistent.  The used to be softer, maybe too soft, but the lastone I bought was almost as still as the Nashfille.  Ths Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is similar to the Kyser and Nashville Capos, but the tension is adjustable and seems to be the best of all combinations. Only downside is I think the Nashville capo looks better."
0,3,"The Planet Waves D'Addario Artist Capo seems like a classic case of trying to do everything and not quite getting it right as a result.  The capo has a micro-adjusting knob, but it is into as consistent with acoustic guitars, such as my Seagull that have non-standard width fretboards.  The built-in pick holder is useful, but Planet Waves offers another, less &#34;Artist&#34; model that also has one.  In fact, the other Planet Waves capo I have is much more amenable to different width necks than this one.  The Artist capo also has an adapter that allows The player to attach one of those small clip-on tuners directly too  the capo.  Assuming that you don't use the capo constantly, why would you want to clip the tuner to the capo instead of to the guitar's headstock?  Check out other offerings from Planet Waves; you can do better for less than with this one."
1,5,"Like many modern capos, this has an unwieldy look to it that I don't like, but once I get past that, this is a top-notch capo that is as good as it gets for capos. I play several very different stringed instruments (guitar, mandolin, octave mandolin, tenor banjo and Irish bouzouki), and I like having a capo that I can use on all of them. This is ideally suited for guitar, but holds its own on all the other instruments. I particularly like that there's nothing hanging out under the bottom to get in the way. I can play right up to the capo without my left hand hitting anything on the underside of the neck.I really like that fact that it's adjustable, and this feature comes in really handy when moving it from guitar to the tenor banjo or mandolin. I also really like theMeideal MCapo10 Bronze Guitar / Banjo / Mandolin Capoas my 'all purpose' capo, and I own several of these because they're inexpensive and just a great product. But this is definitely my new guitar capo, and will replace the Meideal in my case. Great product, solidly built, and it's a bonus that you can add the Micro tuner to the bottom of it.The construction appears to be very solid, and the finish is a flat black baked-on paint (or so it appears). Might be some sort of powder-coating as well. The top bar of the capo is covered with hard black rubber, and the spring seems very strong with great tension. As noted, it will accept a D'Addario micro tuner on the bottom, and includes the bracket for mounting it."
1,5,"Always looking for that elusive perfect capo, light yet strong and dependably firm?You just found it.This is an exemplary capo. No surprise, as it's designed by Ned Steinberger, who understands what it means to strip a guitar down to the basics. It's made of serious aluminum and the spring is super-solid. The tighten feature means you can put it on your guitar and then tighten it so well that it won't come off again until you loosen it. No slippage here! This also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so it's even less in the way of your hand, a very useful feature which most other one-hand capos can't offer.It's an easy on-in-seconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets. The rubber is well-bonded and looks unlikely to pull off for years at least, unlike many cheap capos. It sits well on any six-string, though is not flat enough for a classical. But most of us use capos mainly for acoustic and maybe a bit of electric (unless you're Albert Collins, who always used one and would have loved the tightening aspect here), so this will cover all your basic capo needs.It's got a little slot for the D'Addario brand tuner, but I use a Snark and these two go together well; put on the capo, activate the tuner on the headstock, tune it up, and away you go, perfectly in tune in seconds while using a capo! If you've ever suffered onstage while switching frets with a capo, this is a godsend combo. The capo also has a little pick slot, which will comfortably take up to about a .73 mm pick. It fits .60 picks perfectly, by the way.This NS Artist Capo is well worth 20-25 bucks, and since I got it my Shubb and Kysers have sat lonely in the corner.If you haven't ever experimented with capos, try them out. They can really change the way you play your guitar, and may help you find you sing better than you think, as we all have our best keys, and a capo can help you find yours. I love playing bluegrass licks in G while capoed at the second fret, for instance. The extra zing and crisper tone make me play different licks and it's almost like another instrument. This goes for every fret, pretty much, up to about the sixth, where it gets a little cramped.All in all, this is the best capo I've ever used, especially for this quality at this price."
1,4,"I have to confess to a particular image that comes to mind when I think of capos.  It's the image of an earnest folkie, with mastery of C, G and D, but still struggling with the A. A good player should be comfortable in any key.  But there's still an occasional place for a capo, and that's when you need open strings in a chord.I tested this capo on several guitars, and with one exception it worked well.  Steel-string dreadnought, archtop jazz box, and Les Paul worked nicely.  Not so much on a flat fretboard classical.  The capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck.  But on a flat neck there's a little string buzz on the D and G strings.  While the capo's grip is good, it still needs to be fitted right behind the fret.  This means that it can get a little bit in the way for passage work. That's probably a rare problem for the intended user.All in all it's a nice little capo.  Goes on and off with no fuss and fits the majority of necks."
1,5,"This is the best capo we have (out of three). We were not unhappy with the others until we received this one.Pros:Easy to use tension adjuster that helps tune out buzz and also helps keep the guitar in tune.Easy to put on the guitar. Although the tension is good enough to press the strings down so they don't buzz, it is not so tough as to keep the fingers from compressing the string onto the fret.Nice pick holder feature.The micro adjuster is easy to adjust. It turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring.Cons:None!This is the capo to get!"
1,4,"The capo is pretty good. I like the ability to customize tension. However, it is unclear which way the capo should be put on - with the &#34;pincer&#34; side facing the floor, or facing the ceiling? In either direction, it's a bit awkward to put on/take off, as the angle of the pincer is difficult to get right quickly. The Kaiser is still the best, IMO, but you can't adjust the tension on those. Overall, this is good but not great."
1,5,"Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is as near perfect a capo that I've ever come across. I've been a Kyser Capo gal for many, many years but, this capo has that one beat by a mile. There was absolutely new fret buzz no matter which of my guitars I tried it on or which fret I placed it on. As I strummed each string to sound was so clear. It's also very easy to open with one hand and keep it open, without any stress to your hand, until you release your grip to clamp it into place.I do believe the folks at Planet Waves have developed the best capo ever! And the price ain't so bad either."
1,5,"Notice in the name guitar INPUT. This is not to be confused with the Amplitube iRig which achieves input and output through the iPad/iOS devices headphone jack. Headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems. They also depend on the built in AD/DA converters in the iPad/iOS device. This Apogee Jam 96k is a professional quality INPUT device that has dedicated A/D analogue to digital converter, but depends on the built in hardware of the iPad/iOS device for playback. On the other hand &#34;Apogee One&#34; has both AD and DA convertors for both input and output.Amplitube iRig from IK Multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your iPad. The built in hardware in the iPad is something that I love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the 10 inch screen, but for audio-phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and AD convertor and that is what this Apogee Jam 96k has. Mind you it has that for audio recording input, but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your iPad. You can of course just use that for monitoring your mix, and then save the file in a digital format internally, and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality; e.g. saving as a .Wav file. This makes the Apogee 96k Jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price.So here it the continuum. Amplitube iRig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your iPad etc. The Apogee Jam 96k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on iPad. The Apogee One on the other hand at roughly 3 times the price gives you both AD/DA conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus 2 tracks of recording either 1/4&#34; instrument and/or a balanced external microphone jack. It also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing. It also has 48 volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic. When you get into the Apogee Duet and Quartet you get more connections, plus the all too important option of MIDI connectivity."
1,5,"So, first up:  I've been using Macs to record music since the G4 Cube... yeah, go look that up.  Anyway, I know my way around audio recording on Apple devices.And then: yeah, this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy...BUT: I haven't encountered anything so Plug & Play simple as the Apogee JAM 96k since Gefen introduced the iMic.  Just plug in the USB or Lightning cable, plug in your instrument and GO.Also, it's not flimsy.  It is made of plastic, but the thing has a bit of heft to it and survived a tumble to the floor from my desk.It pulls power from your machine, so no worries about some adapter introducing hum to your recordings. This also helps those of us using electric guitars that don't have extra-wound humbuckers.I tested the Apogee JAM on a new (2014) MacBook Air, an iPhone 5, and a 2013 iPad Mini.  Garageband instantly knew what was going on, but ProTools did need a bit of coaching.A small device that doesn't color input sound and doesn't get in the way... just what I needed!"
1,5,"The apogee Jam works great and it sounds great. The operation is very simple: you plug in your guitar and plug in to your Mac or ios device. I have mine hooked up to my MacBook, running Garage Band. If there is any latency I can't hear it. It works beautifully. Apogee is known for making good music products and this Jam is no exception. I was able to plug in a microphone (line level) into this as well and record my vocals. Likewise, it worked well with my 4-string bass as well. I was able to record a whole song in no time. For a simple audio interface, this is affordable and dependable."
1,5,"4.6 starsMy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality. The A/D is often weak, and there is sometimes too much latency for it to be useful for multi-tracking. Apogee covers both areas well with this little puppy; the A/D is quite smooth, and it transfers the signal near perfectly. And little it is, not much bigger than the jack. If Bon Scott only knew...But small though it may be, there's plenty of signal processing power in there, and while it doesn't stand up my best outboard gear, it offers very clean, clear sound transfers from guitar, bass, keys and line mics, so that you can do good-sounding entire tunes on your laptop with only the JAM as interface. Which is yet another step forward in high-quality home recordings. I like the thought that we're getting closer to folks releasing things entirely by themselves on their own sites, and not paying Crapple a huge chunk of profits for merely hosting a file. Record companies and file hosts are increasingly anachronistic due to tech like this JAM, and maybe soon enough we'll see artists keeping ALL of the profits from their art. Imagine that!This offers very close to studio quality, but keep in mind that even with 24-bit it is solid state. Once you've used a good tube preamp you know what a difference in warmth in can make. I ran this through one of mine and the A/B made it very obvious that old school studio gear still has its place.Speaking of Crapple, the ads for this suggest that it is for iStuff only, which is not true. I ran it on 7 Ultimate and it worked a charm, so don't be fooled by the typically proprietary ads, which Cook and co. probably insist on: &#34;Don't mention anybody but us! Offer no alternatives! They must stay in our universe!&#34; Well, you needn't, this works with almost anything, so don't be fooled by the ad copy.The only negative I can find is that it is a little chintzy in outer build, making one wonder how good the internals are, and how long they'll hold up. A stronger, more solid sleeve would have been nice, especially at the price of 130. But it does sound good, though as it may be used for portable purposes, you might want to wrap it for transport in a little hand towel or such to make sure shocks don't mess with it. Take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music!"
1,4,"This will work with my daughter's iPod Touch generation 4.  However, the ""Garage Band"" app is for iOS 7, and hers is an iOS 6.1 and will not update to 7.  So, though she can't use Garage Band, there are others that are supposed to work.  She downloaded the Ampkit app and it works great with her iPod and the Apogee Jam.Here is a list of other apps that are supposed to work with the Apogee Jam:AmpkitAmpliTube (version 2.5 or greater)Amps & CabsAnytuneApple GarageBandAudio Deck ProfessionalBias iProRecorderEveryDay LooperFairlight SamplerFantastocrats StudioMiniGibson's L&M;Hindenburg Field RecorderiAnalyzeriMovieiRecorder ProiShred LiveJamUpLoopyMcDSP Retro RecorderMultitrack DAWNano Studio (TRG-16 pad sampling)PocketAmpPocketGKReap DFXRiot FXRock Prodigy: GuitarScratchTonesSonoma FourTrackSonoma GuitarToneStudio Devil Guitar AmpTaylor EQVocaLive (version 1.5 or greater)Voice MemosXewton Music Studio 2.0It's a pretty cool idea, but the cords are a nuisance.  Most electric guitar players like to stand while playing, and the cords need some managing to keep them out of the way and not have them pull out of their connections.  I was surprised at how small the JAM is.....slightly bigger than a Bic cigarette lighter.  Using this is much more convenient than lugging an amp around, and it saves on other's ears and nerves if they can only hear the acoustic playing of the guitar strings, especially if you are beginner guitarist!Overall pretty good, and very simple to operate.  Just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice.  My daughter also used it to record her playing and said that was easy to do."
1,5,"I've been recording on my iMac, iPod Touch, iPad, and iPhone for some time, using Garage Band. Interfacing with the iMac is easy, using various USB devices- I'm currently using a USB-equipped Alesis preamp. iOS device interface is a bit more difficult; it is possible to use USB preamps, with an externally powered USB hub, but that starts getting very complicated and messy.  I've been using simple devices like the 1K that  split the headphone/microphone jack into two separate cords, one for headphone, and one for guitar. The problem with this sort of configuration is that it's very easy to overload the microphone input, and the recording quality done this way is not very good. The Apogee JAM is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons. First, it contains its own dedicated preamp and A/D, and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity. Interface issues are non-existent; plugged into both the iPad and iPhone it was immediately recognized. I didn't have any problems with either of the three supplied cables.The JAM is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces, but on the whole I think it's worth it. It's simple to use, has no detectable latency, and delivers excellent sound quality. It does seem to draw a fair amount of current, and battery life  is shortened significantly when using this with an iPhone. You'll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions. With the iPad, this isn't as noticeable. Even with that issue, I think the JAM is a good value.  The various iOS devices are capable of making very high quality recordings, but only with quality input. Given the cost of an new iPhone or iPad, the cost of the JAM is rather trivial in comparison."
1,5,"These may be my new favorite bass strings.Likes:- Bright.  I'd call them &#34;very bright&#34;, except they don't seem to have the harsh twangy tone I'd expect.  They seem bright, yet still soft.- Clear.. The lows sound present and clear.- Consistent flex.  Once I had these on for a couple of days, the tuning seemed very stable.  The tone seems to sharpen less when they are played hard, compared to my last strings.- D'Addario brand.  To me, these guys have a long history of making excellent strings.- Playability.  These feel pretty supple and effortless to work with.- Price. I feel like I should be paying more for these strings.Technology:- New design. &#34;Textured round&#34;.  This is a round-wound string with a hex-shaped core.Overall, love these.  Especially for the price."
1,5,This is the perfect fit for all my basses. I have two Ibanez and two Essex basses. They recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge. I play fingerstyle and they feel great. They have corrosion resistant packaging and since corrosion is what kills your strings the longer you can keep it at bay the better. They are made in  the USA and they use recycled packaging. I cannot attest to their lifespan but the package says long life so we will concede that point.
1,5,"I'm mainly a guitarist but I do play bass from time to time on an old Fender American. These strings are very bright in a good way with a clear, smooth sound. I love the tone you get out of these, very bluesy and the punch isn't too rough it's just right. I'm a huge fan of D'Addario, been using their strings for at least 4 years and they never disappoint. Give these a try if you're looking for some new strings."
1,4,"I put the set on my Squire Jazz Bass with threaded bridge rollers. If you don't like loading up the tuners, trim a few inches off the leads; they're about 8-9 inches and have no cloth covering like Fenders. I usually play medium gauge flatwounds on this bass and the FlexSteels have overall less tension. I let out the truss rod a half turn to eliminate buzzing (yeah, ironic for a set designed for slapping).Gave them a good stretch and they're holding pitch well. I find the windings on the FlexSteels more comfortable than Rotosounds - at least comparing new-to-new. That helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting.Overall I'm more into jazz and classic prog than slapping and there's plenty of 'piano low-end sproing' (Squire, Lake and Ray Bennett fans will feel right at home, fingers or pick). The set is so bright-sounding in fact I had to roll a considerable amount off.The label says 'Light Top/Medium Bottom' (45-65-85-105): I found the gauge balance between the low E-A and the high D-G a little more pronounced than I'd like, but not outright uncomfortable."
1,5,"I've been using D' Addario strings for 20+ years to great satisfaction.  These flex steels are excellent.  Bass tones, response and resonance are superior to my ear.  You can't go wrong with these guys."
1,5,"I play guitar and bass, but the gitpicker in me envies full-time bassists because they almost never break strings, and bass strings hold their tone far longer than guitar strings. The price has also come down to where you can spend well under a hundred bucks a year on strings and always have fresh tone rich with harmonics. You don't know how good you've got it! And these D'Ad's are very good all-round strings, though they make a lot more noise than flatwounds and even ""normal"" nickel wound, so they're not for sloppy fingers.Very nice for funky players and those who want more definition and edge, these FlexSteels ring nicely and I like that the bottom E is a tad thicker at 105 than the usual light set's 100. Because these are pretty bright, that extra oomph is nice. And I'm a big believer that the amp can fix string issues much more easily with bass than guitar, so merely dialing out a little treble or even rolling off the volume a bit on your bass will take care of that. But if you're popping and slapping, these come through loud and clear. I really like the feel of the low E when I thumb pop with these.I play a P-bass with my index, middle and thumb, and these punch nicely at that scale length. The pickups also like them, and they get plenty loud, with full definition and plenty of top end, but not brittle. With a Trace Elliot or other high-def amp, these would be very unforgiving for all but the most exact players. I bet Marcus would kill with them.I think these are perfect for funk, and excellent for almost all rock styles. Obviously flats are better for jazz, but these make a good all-around string and for less than 20 clams they're a great deal."
1,5,"A great set of bass strings with all the right features:- Perfect balance of bright/punch and warmth- Right, deep tones- Great feel and playability- Stable tuning- &#8220;Textured round&#8221; design with hexagonal core shape- Durable- Easy to stringMy father uses D&#8217;Addario on his telecaster and acoustic guitars, which originally prompted me to choose D&#8217;Addario for my Fender Jazz bass.  I can say that the brands&#8217; reputation carries over to bass&#8212;these are phenomenal strings."
1,4,"I've been using D'Addario XL nickel wounds on my P-Bass for a long time. They have a lot of tone, they seem to last a long time, and they're not very expensive. These strings have the same feel as the nickel wounds, but are a lot brighter You get lots of overtones and high end from these. The choice of gauges is a little different from the regular XLs, too; instead of the .085 A and the .100 E they have a .085 A and a .105 E. That's just enough to give you a slightly more solid low end, and more metal to dig into, while retaining low tension in the D and G. I'm more of an old-school player and prefer nickel for that mellower sound, but if you're into funk or more modern sounds, you may feel that the bright SS sound is for you, and if so, these are a great string."
1,5,I installed these on a Fender Jazz bass with active electronics. After stringing them up & tuning I immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded. I play finger style and they really added a clear definition to each note played. They sounded great all up & down the fret board. Where I really noticed the difference was in recording. Been working on a new batch of songs and a the bass to the songs on the recordings made after these strings is noticeably superior to the ones made before. Except for the songs with acoustic bass I will be going back and re recording the bass parts to the songs made before I installed these strings. I  don't play slap or pick bass so I can't say how well they work for those styles but for my purpose they come very highly recommended.
1,5,"I have to admit this up front - I'm a terrible bass player. I play guitar and keep a bass in the music room for times when I have friend over to jam. I do dabble with the bass, but I'm not proficient with it. That being said; I really appreciate the difference these strings make in sound, playability and durability. These strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time. They have &#34;punch&#34; and &#34;snap&#34; which are good things to have in a bass. I haven't had them on for a real long time, but in the time I've had them they remain consistent and show absolutely no sound or metal degradation in the time they've been on my Fender MIM Jazz bass. When I need another set, I'll buy these!"
1,5,"These are some bright strings!I play with a pick and mostly stay in the realm of rock 'n' roll, so no comments on the slapping and popping claims the packaging makes, but there are plenty of great rock tones to be found.  Heck, crank the amp and dig in with a pick and these would be great strings for any Motorhead covers you're planning on playing!  Good bright steel tone, not anywhere near as harsh on your fingertips (or frets!) as Rotosounds, and they're only a Jackson, not a bad string!"
1,5,"Likes:- Pretty smooth.  Minimal fret noise and squeak compared to some- Bright, strong mids.- They do seem to stay in tune well.  Havent had to change tuning once they settled in.Will update this review with more experience as I play on these strings over the next week."
1,4,"My daughter is learning how to play and the .11 - .48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain.I put a set of the D'Addario NYXY0942 strings on my backup guitar and tuned it up. Usually, I've had issues when bringing some brands of strings up to pitch, but the D'Addario's seemed to do a much better job. I nearly always stress the higher pitch strings a bit before bringing them up to their final pitch and they stabilized quickly. The wound strings also seem quite stable. Frequently, it takes up to a couple of days for some strings to settle in, but I've seen no such issues with the D'Addario's.I usually use thicker strings on my guitars to get a fatter tone, but I was impressed by the sound of these in spite of them being much thinner than I usually like.My daughter is also very happy with them since they're not quite so tough on her fingers."
1,5,"Put these on my G&L; S500 electric. Sound great, play great, keeping their tune. None broken yet, but I don't usually break strings. I play at home for pleasure and recording, not out hitting the clubs. Blues, blues slide, rock, metal.I use D'Addario strings a lot. I try others but always come back to them. These will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on. I really like them."
1,4,"I usually don't use anything lighter than 10s because I think the tone starts to get thin on both the highs or the lows.  I had already tried these in the 10 gauge size, and when these were offered via the Vine program, I thought what the heck.  I have a guitar which I believe the tension is always high and tried these on that instrument.  They do seem to help the string tension issue and the low end sounds (to these 62 year old ears) quite comparable to the 10s.  However, I do think there is still a thinning of the high end, but that's subjective.  I gave the 10s a 5 rating, and, realistically, I would give these 4.5 id I could.  If you're into 9 gauge strings I recommend these, but I'll stick with 10s and 11s."
1,5,"I have preferred Ernie Ball Extra Lights which is a nickel string. They have a smooth depth of tone which is my preference. The NYXL's have a brighter tone, good playing ease, and stay in tune better when making new string changes. If you have a mahogany body guitar such as the Les Paul junior specials then the added top end would make a very nice match, or if you like a brighter tone on any guitar the same applies.These are not coated strings which a lot of strings in this price range are. Pertaining to output I am a firm believer that although you can notice a difference quite readily between certain types of stings in &#34;acoustic/unamplified&#34; output, but once you plug them into an amp with a volume knob the difference disappears.These do stay in tune better than my usual Ernie Balls nickels when you first put them on. The nickel takes a day to stretch into the tension of proper pitch. These have their tension adjust better on the first day of use. After the nickels set in you may not notice much of a difference. I find that by lightly sanding the nut with 1000 grit paper, and using Big Ben's Nut Sauce on all of the contact points of the string does more for keeping a guitar in tune than any other. Having these NYXL's on there is just one more added benefit.I would say if you are looking for a brighter tone, with better tuning stability, these are the ones to have. You can tell from the wall to wall 5 star reviews these are the one to have."
1,5,"I normally get Elixir strings, but these sounded too good to pass up. They are indeed some high tech strings, with features including break resistance and improved tuning stability. Plus they feel and sound good. So grab a pack and get jamming. You'll definitely want to check these out."
1,4,"At about twice the price of their standard strings, These D'Addario NYXL strings make lots of enticing claims about tuning stability, higher breaking point, and something called &#34;fusion twist&#34; (which I swear is a rare Chubby Checker B-side).Having just put a set of these on one of my guitars, I can't speak to any of the claims of superiority over other strings, but I can say they are solid, dependable strings with lots of &#34;punch and crunch&#34;."
1,5,I ordered these for my husband the guitar player.  He loves these strings.  He said they are high quality and make his guitar sound great!  Highly recommended.
1,5,Great strings with a good feel to them. They are size 10-46 which is just right for my electric guitars. I won't know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey. If they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and I will switch if they last a long time. I don't think of these as extra lights (09-42) they are more of a light to me.
1,5,"I am,  primarily, an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago, a Gibson Les Paul. What I am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars. Most name-brand strings are just fine, but some are markedly different than others. A few are actually a notch-above the others. These NYXLs from D'Addario are definitely in that 'notch above' category.I find them easier to play, better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others I have tried. I plan to stick with them.  A few comments about each area:Playability:These NYXLs bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting (left) hand than do most of the others. Of course I have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent - but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore. These strings seem less 'cutting', even after a couple of hours of constant playing. THey also 'squeak' less when I slide up and down the neck.Sound:The sound is crisp and rich at the same time. Most electric guitarists who I know tend to prefer one of these qualities over the other and choose their strings accordingly. I prefer a blend of both - just as I do for my acoustic instruments.  These NYXLs provide the closest blend that I have been able to achieve of these two different but complimentary characteristics, andTuning:Tuning and re-tuning can drive a guitar player to distraction.  Even some really good sounding strings don't hold the tuning very well and even after only one brief riff, need to be adjusted by at least a quarter tone. These NYXLs are holding the tuning FAR better than the others I have used. Less time tuning = more good time playing!All-in-all, I found no flaw in these strings. There is always something new coming along and D'Addario's formulation that uses high carbon steel alloy in the manufacture of these strings seems to make a considerable and positive difference.  UNtil someone comes up with something better, I expect to stick with them!"
1,5,"I'm a long time D'Addario user. From the time I started playing I've tried most of the different brands out there and always end up back with my D'Addarios. I got the .09's to try on my Strat and the .10's to try on my LP and found that these new NYXL strings do have a little better output and stay in tune a little better but the trade off is the cost. Currently they're $11.99 on here compared to $4.99 or less for the regular version. So if you burn through a lot of strings, that may be a consideration. I don't go through strings that frequently (I'll change on each guitar every 2 to 3 months) so it's not a big concern for me."
1,5,"I've used D'Addario strings for years and they never fail me. These extra light are great for playing lead as they're easy to bend and feel great on your fingers. As they are extra light strings, they serve limited purposes but as for tone quality it is very smooth and clear. For a brand as a whole i'd recommend D'Addario strings to any guitarist and for gauge it's really dependent on play-style and role if you are in a group."
1,5,"I usually play an .11 on top and first grabbed my digital caliper to confirm the gauge of the high E in this set &#8211; it felt heavier than a .10, but the LED doesn&#8217;t lie and it confirmed .10.I put the NYXL set on my Ibanez Artist with DiMarzio  humbuckers. I stretch new strings out of habit; I don&#8217;t like the constant slipping as they settle.  I stretch all six strings in about 4-5 segments up the neck, retune, and hope for the best.There&#8217;s no whammy bar on the Artist and, for the first few days, I did a lot of blues bending to see how they&#8217;d hold up - the NYXLs stayed in tune very solidly with only minor tweaking as to be expected with any strings.I chose a darker-sounding guitar than a single-coil Fender, hoping the supposed brightness of the NYXLs would be more noticeable. On this guitar I usually play D&#8217;Addario XLs and an Ernie Ball &#8216;pink&#8217; set on my Strat so I&#8217;ve got two points of reference.In terms of tone, from the start the NYXLs sound much closer to &#8216;broken in&#8217; than the Ernie Balls. There&#8217;s far less &#8216;new jangle&#8217; to them and, while they&#8217;re bright, they&#8217;re manageable for the kind of tone I&#8217;m after. I play jazz in a more contemporary vein &#8211; in terms of tone more Scofield and Abercrombie than Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall.  I like a rich tone with some high end but without too much &#8216;klang&#8217;.In terms of feel and tension the NYXLs are stiffer and closer to the regular XLs than to Slinkys, which is probably to be expected. But oddly, the windings of the low E-A-D remind me a bit more of the Ernie Balls than XLs, whose windings feel a bit wider.Three weeks on, with the onset of warm humid weather around here the strings are showing no rust and still sound fresh.With so many players going through modeled amps and effects it&#8217;s a fair question just how much the tonal quality of electric strings still matters &#8211; or are we headed for &#8216;virtual strings&#8217; designed mostly for durability and intonation. Will we be dialing in &#8216;new and klangy&#8217;, &#8216;broken in with worn windings, or &#8216;sweated through and rusty&#8217;.I like to believe there are enough players out there young and old still fussy about tone and the role a good set of strings plays in delivering it.  To them I&#8217;d say these are worth checking out."
1,5,"I've been using Ernie Balls cobalt slinky light gauge because I like the feel.  I got these from the Vine, and wow, they are awesome.  They cost no more than the strings I normally get, but the tone and feel is totally different.  I can't comment on how long they'll last or keep in tune..but for now, I'm impressed.  I'll probably keep using these on my Santana PRS for awhile since I like the sound.  Every once in awhile, I'll step outside of my box...I mean.. I know the strings that I like and I tend to stick with them.  I use d'addario on my acoustic guitars, and ernie balls on my electrics..except for my strat..I like fender bullets on it.  So the sample from the Vine...sorta of nudged me..and I'm the better for it."
1,5,"I have used D' Addario electric guitar strings for years and have always loved their feel, playability, tone and reliability.  This set is no exception.  Light gauge for those who like to shred a little more but still great tone.  Highly recommend anything by D' Addario."
1,5,"For a long time, I never thought much about guitar strings. I pretty much thought they were all the same.In fact, guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days. D'Addario has gotten into the act with these NYXL strings, and I have to say that they are not like any other strings I've used.The feel is different, and the sound is different. Different in a WOW way. Yeah, they're more expensive, but they're worth it. I'm a cheapskate, and I can't go back to cheap strings.Now I'm spoiled, and I've become a guitar strings snob."
1,5,"My father is a full-time gigging musician primarily on Steel Guitar and Telecaster.  He has been playing over 50 years and it takes a lot to get him interested in new strings.  We both use D'Addario strings almost exclusively (myself on bass guitar, and him on the electric).  These are *outstanding* strings with great durability, playability and exceptional sound.  They remain in tune for long gigs or recording sessions, they generate less fret noise than comparable strings and have a bright/crisp sound that really stands out. Well worth the extra investment.  Highly recommended!"
1,5,"D'Addario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around. I've used their strings for electric & acoustic bass, electric and acoustic guitar, Irish bazouki, mandolin, Irish tenor banjo, 5 string banjo & even used their octave mandolin strings on my Serbian brach always with stellar results. When they said these were deluxe premium strings I knew it wouldn't be hype. I was right. I strung my guitar with these about 3 weeks ago & have probably played the guitar 25 or so hours at gigs and in the studio. I've never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of 3- 45 minute sets but these did. And I was sober so it wasn't just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune. Not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when I played it. Of course that wouldn't mean a thing if they didn't feel good on the fingers. They do. Like they were custom made for your guitar. They were on my Rickenbacker so I can't honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but I strongly suspect they would. Not only do they stay in tune but 3 weeks later they still sound crisp & new. I'm going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good.  I usually change my strings every other week when I'm playing regularly so I'm already passed my regular limit. I may update this review in a month or so when I know how long they lasted. Most highly recommended!"
1,5,I usually use Gibson Vintage Nickle Strings on my electric guitars but when I had an opportunity to try theses strings out I jumped at the chance. I put them on a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop guitar with P-90 pickups. I had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed. They had some great &#34;spank&#34; and sounded great. Easy to play (they almost seemed thinner than advertised - they play like 9's but sounded like tens). I am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the Gibson strings. Next I want to try a set on a Strat and see how they sound - I suspect they will sound and play great!
1,5,"Excellent tone, and I'm a bit surprised by that.  I mean, D'Addario strings are fine and all, but that's it, they've always just been your average basic string to me.  These promise to be a premium contender and they certainly deliver.  I strung up my Agile AL-3000 (best Les Paul copy you can buy, look them up) with them, tuned up and these things roared!  Rich full harmonic tone, with plenty of bend and sustain.  These strings really do feel and sound great.  I never thought I'd be praising D'Addario so much, but these strings really do deliver."
1,5,"I've been stringing my guitars with D'Addario for several years.  While my jazz box is set up with heavy strings, my Les Paul goes lighter--horses for courses, you might say.  I've been using D'Addario XL strings on this guitar for a while, although it's the EXL140 (slightly larger bottoms).  But why not give these lighter strings a try?  The quality is obviously high.  Tone is good, as is durability.  If you do much complex chording, you're going to miss the heavier string, but for shredders and pure rock players these are very nice.  I'll be going back to the EXL 140s, since I prefer the more positive feel of the larger string.  But fat or skinny, D'Addario makes some of the best strings out there."
0,3,"Don't get me wrong, the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable. There's a little more &#34;brightness&#34; to the output, they are a little more long-lasting, and they stay in tune quicker and longer than the normal XL120. This is a good string.But it looks like the going rate on these strings will be 12 bucks a set. I can get three sets of regular (excellent) XL120 strings for that money, and if the NYXL lasted 3 times as long then they'd be worthwhile, but I've been able to try them twice now, and they don't last 3 times as long.Great string, great innovation, great achievement, drastically overpriced."
1,5,"These have a nice bright sound and are easy on the fingers with a light action. Pretty deluxe strings for the price here on Amazon. I have them on my travel acoustic six string (Martin) and am happy, especially since I am not a &#34;pro&#34; guitarist and my fingers can get sore.I say, get 'em!"
1,5,"D'Addario's NYXL1046 Nickel Plated Electric Guitar Strings, I have the Light, are THE best! I've got them on my Fender Strat. I can tune my guitar and play it for a couple hours and still not have it go out of tune. Even if I'm using the tremolo bar and bending strings these things stay in tune. When I get together with other guitar players to jam I don't have to worry about being the one who has to keep tuning my guitar. A couple Ernie Ball die hards are about ready to jump ship and get on the D'Addario Line after seeing mine in action.I can put my Strat aside, pick it up to play a few days later and it's still in tune. Doesn't happen when I pick up my other electric that don't have these strings on it yet. Either I'm going to have to put these on my other electric or the Fender is going to be my baby who gets all the play time with Mama.I've never used strings that bend so well. And they don't cut into my fingers as much when playing for extended periods of time. These are miracle strings in my mind.Most importantly, they sound GREAT!Good going D'Addario!"
1,5,"Just put these on my Martin DCX1E and they sound great! This is a big guitar that really rings out and the Elixir strings have a great sparkle with a clear bright tone. Playing rhythm guitar, flat picking and fingerpicking.I can't say if they last longer, vine has us review this asap. After daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning. I have used Elixir nano web strings before and I do think they keep their tone a bit longer. That being said, my go to strings are still D'addario."
1,5,"I ordered this for my husband, the musician. He said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel. He would definitely purchase this product...and he's pretty picky about his guitar strings!"
1,5,"I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars. Somehow, I had gravitated over to other brands including Martin and D'Addario.  I got a set of these strings as well as the Phosphor Bronze design through the Vine program and chose to this set out on a Seagull Artist Mosaic rather than on a Taylor, Martin or Gibson. The result is outstanding - So much so, that I am beginning to restring all 7 of my acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars with Elixers again.I have also tried the new Phosphor Bronze strings in this series on a Gibson and had fine results.  Because I did not use both sets of strings on the same guitar, it is not possible for me to really compare/contract the. These strings play as smoothly and easily as do the Phosphor Bronzes and seem to add a good deal of depth to the already resonant mellowness of the Seagull.Elixer definitely still has the edge. Thanks to Bob Taylor and his crew for collaborating on something that benefits all guitar players - no matter what it says on the head stocks of our instruments."
1,5,"I can't speak on the claim for a longer string life.  The strings are true to Elixir's quality and tone.  These strings sound great plug and unplugged.  I also had the opportunity from Vine to try the phosphor bronze too.  There are tonal differences as expected.  The 80/20 are brighter, but the tones are clear and crisp.  When amplified, I did note less finger noise as I re-positioned or slid my fingers along the strings.  I didn't notice any difference to the feel of the string...as compared to other nanoweb Elixir strings that I have used over the years.  Time will tell if these strings last longer than their other versions.  For now, even if they only last as long as the other nanoweb ... you're still getting a good deal."
1,5,Great product with nice feel and tone. I'm only sorry I pre-ordered only two sets at $12.49. The average price now is $15 and over. I'll bite the bullet and order more after I wear these two sets out. Hopefully improved availability will lower the price by the time I need new strings. These are durable and long lasting. Recommeded.
1,4,"I have reviewed these strings before, and frankly, I wasn't all that impressed with the tone the first time around. I think they feel great on the fingertips and they're very playable, especially for a picker, but I just wasn't sold on the tone. To be fair, I only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars, and found them lacking. There seemed to be a drop-ff in tone when switching from my usual strings (Martin SPs) to these.So this time, I decided to try them on a much smaller guitar. I have a Yairi Alvarez AY-20, which is a 000 sized guitar, and they sound terrific. I'm no engineer or physicist, so I really can't explain the mechanics of it all, but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body, and they produce a very clear, bright tone across the higher range, and hold their own on the low range.I still don't think they're the best thing since sliced bread, and I still think they're a bit overpriced, but I have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than I would expect. This seems to have no effect on the tone, but for what these cost, you'd think the coating would last a lot longer than two months (I play daily for at least 30 minutes a day).Overall, these are good (but overpriced) strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars. You'll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them, and which don't. In my experience, large body guitars lose tone, but they sound great on a smaller body."
1,5,"I had the opportunity to try a set of Elixir Nanoweb light gauge (.013 - .053) strings in both Phosphor Bronze and 80/20 Bronze. Instead of writing a separate review for each, I figured I&#8217;d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needs.The Phosphor Bronze strings are mounted on a brand new Guild F-47 RC guitar. It is a concert sized guitar with a Florentine cutaway. The body is Brazilian Rosewood and the top is Adirondack (Red) Spruce. I have always heard that Phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a Rosewood guitar. I would agree. The tone is nicely balanced &#8211; maybe a bit weak in the bass, but the strings are new and in a couple days I expect them to sound a bit better.  The notes are articulated well, and there is a nice midrange tone.The Nanoweb coating is nice. It protects the strings from corrosion (finger sweat really can do a job on strings) without dulling the sound. I think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original (Guild) strings, and it just plays easier.The 80/20 strings are mounted on a Gibson Hummingbird &#8211; an iconic Mahogany body/Spruce-topped Dreadnaught sized guitar. Again, 80/20s are recommended for Mahogany guitars. As popular as the Hummingbird is, I was never totally pleased with the sound of it.  It is a great guitar to strum along with while singing, but it almost sounded too muddied &#8211; not enough articulation between the different strings. The Elixir strings really bring out something extra from the Gibson. It sounds a LOT better and feels easier to play. The strings are easier to play &#8211; partially because of the coating &#8211; partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity &#8211; without going out of tune.The bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes. I am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the Martin SPs that were on it prior to the switch.Elixirs are not the cheapest strings out there, but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings, in the end you won&#8217;t spend more money on what I think are far superior strings."
0,2,"I was looking forward to trying these, as I've loved this company's product since day one.But I think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;HD&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price. More profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon.I have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened. The bottom dropped out, the top end stopped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when I strum with a pick.When I play with fingers it's better, but not worth spending more money on than the normal .012s I've been using (which I think I liked a lot better).It's possible that these work great on the Taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but I'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these.Again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;HD&#34; moniker... no thanks."
1,5,"I put these strings on my Guild acoustic electric. I play mainly rhythm guitar to accompany my singing and do a bit of fingerpicking.The warmth of phosphor bronze strings suits my style and these strings have a great tone with crisp high notes and full rich bass ends.They are made by Taylor and all Taylor guitars come with Elixir strings. Saving up for a Taylor, in the meantime, at least I can afford the strings!These are very good long-lasting strings. To me, D'addario are just as good. Things like strings and picks are subjective. Try different brands to find what suits you best. If you are a serious player with a good guitar you should definitely check these strings out."
1,5,"I ordered this for my husband, the musician.  He said these are high quality strings giving great tone and good feel.  He would definitely purchase this product again."
1,5,"I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars. Somehow, I had gravitated over to Martin PB about a year ago (when I acquired a new Martin... Surprise!) I got a set of these strings through the Vine program and chose to try them out on a Gibson Songwriter Studio Deluxe CE RATHER than on a Taylor or Martin. The result is outstanding - So much so, that I am beginning to restring all 7 of my acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars with Elixers again.They are even smoother and easier to play that I remembered them. Of course, these new strings have improved the technology which becomes more and more important to me as my fingers age right along with the rest of my body. The sound is sweet and warm and the Gibson has never sounded better - played plugged-in or unplugged.Elixer definitely still has the edge. Thanks to Bob Taylor and his crew for collaborating on something that benefits all guitar players - no matter what it says on the head stocks of our instruments."
1,5,"True to phosphor bronze these strings have a mellow and full sound.  You still get finger noise as you slide your fingers when setting up for the next chord, but the noise is somewhat less. I have used other Elixir nonweb coated strings and these strings are in par with them.  I can't speak to the string life.  The boast of these strings is that will last 3 to 5 times longer, and if that is the case, I will run out of time to submit my feedback.  So far now, they sound great, feel great...and if they don't last as long as the other Elixirs, you'll still come out ahead since they shouldn't cost any more."
1,5,"I've used Elixirs for about five years now. This set offers the same great sound for my acoustic as their electric strings provide for my electric. Some people don't like the polymer (nanoweb) that coats the string, but I find that it cuts back on string noise. Sliding your fingers around doesn't cause too much noise, and with acoustic strings I find that very important, especially if you're using a piezo pickup in your instrument. Phosphor Bronze has always been a great alloy for acoustic guitars IMHO. These are great strings, worth the money, and sound great. They also last 3 times longer than regular, non-coated strings in my experience (been playing for 24yrs). Great product."
1,4,"I'm a D'Addario man myself, but hey free is free.  So I jumped at a chance to try these strings out.  Thus far they have proven durable both in terms of playability and longevity of tone.  So many other variables to consider when rating strings such as the guitar they go on, the gauge of string being used, the playing style and climate of the end user, etc.  These are a solid performing string set, though I am unlikely to switch allegiances from D'Addario any time soon.  Still there is no reason to fear trying these Elixir's out."
1,5,"I really like these strings.  While they are not quite as bright sounding as uncoated strings, they still sound better than many other strings, AND they last so much longer.  They will easily out last a set of uncoated strings by at least 2x... probably closer to 3x.  Nice tactile feel on the right hand with reduced squeak as you move up & down the neck.Bottom line is Elixir's sound great, play well and least a really long time."
0,3,"I have lots of friends who play these strings. Some love them more than any other string, and some are like me. They're clearly good strings, and I love the way they play and feel on my fingertips, but I can't get past the sound. It could just be about how the strings sound on my particular guitars, but in any case, I'm not happy with the sound and that's why I have a hard time giving them a solid five-star rating.I tried these on two separate guitars I play regularly, and wasn't terribly impressed with the sound on either. One is a vintage dreadnought mahogany guitar that normally has excellent tone, and is crisp, clear and fairly loud. These strings softened the tone, which I wasn't looking to do. They sound okay, but nowhere near as good as the Martin SPs I use to really bring out the best in that guitar.I also have a cutaway electric/acoustic I use to sing with because it's fairly quiet, and the softer tones don't drown out my voice. These strings made the guitar even more quiet, and there was a considerable drop-off in tone quality as well. They might have been cheap, old strings, because I couldn't tell that there was anything special about them. This particular guitar didn't have spectacular sound to begin with, and these strings did nothing to improve it. I like strings to either sound as good as other strings, or improve the tone and pull more from the guitar. These strings did neither for me. However, they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp.Based upon my experimentation, I would guess that if you have a great sounding guitar and you're not a fanatic about slight drops in tonal quality, you'll love the way these strings feel and play. I rate them excellent in that category. But for me, tone is 80% of the equation. I'd play wire-wrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings. In the tonal category, these strings fell short. On a guitar with excellent tone, I noticed a distinct drop in tone quality, and on another softer, more muted guitar, tone quality vanished.In the final analysis, if you're a picker and your guitar can be plugged in, you'll love these strings. If you're really into great acoustic tone and your guitar doesn't have stellar tone to begin with, you might gain some 'playability,' but you will most likely experience a slight drop in tonal quality."

1,5,"I've been thinking about trying the Nanoweb strings for a while, but I was a bit put off by the high price (they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings I've been buying)  and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller. I was intrigued by the promise of long life, though; I have a Taylor Big Baby that I bought used, and which came with a set of Nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year- and they didn't sound at all like old strings. This review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new.I'd just changed the strings on my 1970s Gibson Gospel a week ago, so I decided that would be my reference. The Nanowebs went on my 1970s Guild D-35. Both are well broken in, solid spruce top guitars. The Gospel is a bit brighter sounding, but I'm pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars. If they D-35 sounded dull, I'd notice.As I was unwrapping the Nanowebs I noticed that while they were labeled ""Light"" gauge, they had a 0.013"" E string- something you'd be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings. The B was a .017, compared to the .016 of the D'Addarios I usually play. The rest of the strings were there usual light gauges. Turns out that these are ""HD Light"" gauge, designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end. The difference shouldn't be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so I went ahead and installed them on the D-35.So how do they sound? The unwound E and B don't sound different from any other plain steel string, of course. The E does feel a tiny bit stiffer, when I switch between the D-35 and the Gospel. Sound-wise, I'd say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day. I wouldn't call them dull by any stretch of the imagination. If I didn't know that they were coated strings I certainly wouldn't be able to tell from playing them. So they're good sounding strings, and they last a long time. That leaves the question of cost- are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings?Here's the way I see it: If you're a heavy strummer, or playing gigs every night, maybe not. You're probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they'd go dull from corrosion or contamination. But if you're a finger picker, or a light strummer, a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run. And if you're a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house, and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family, coated strings are probably an excellent choice. For myself, I'm going to leave these on the D-35 for as long as they still sound good. I'll update this review when I find out just how long they do last.Follow up: After playing these for a few days, I actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my Loar LH-350, an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars. They sound great on the Loar, and now I have two guitars to do a long term test on."
1,4,"I have tried coated strings in the past ( including Elixirs) and have never been very fond of them. Whenever I tried them I felt a certain disconnect from my guitar. Somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom. Not that I hated them, just didn't really love them. These are the best ones I've tried so far. I still don't like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs I mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off. If you need a longer lasting string for whatever the reason these are really the best out there. After a dozen or so gigs with them, they still sound the same as when I put them on."
1,4,"Well, MADE by Elixir and DEVELOPED with Taylor Guitars ... these strings were designed for the new 800 (Rosewood) series guitars that came out this year (2014) ... the promise is a &#34;bolder high end, fuller low end&#34; ... I am a long-time Taylor owner and favor their 800 series (Rosewood/Spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods) ... I have almost always used Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze lights on my guitars ... I like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings ... I have never had any issues with Elixir Nanowebs ... I recently picked up an 812ce First Edition 12-Fret ... such a fine instrument and it came with the Elixir HD's ... took some getting used to as far as feel (due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings - E, B & G) ... but as far as sound, they are great ... the D, A & low E strings are no different from the regular Elixir PB Lights so I am not sure about the claim of &#34;fuller low end&#34; ... compared to what?  Unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response ... I am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than Taylor's but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings ... that is what I notice most from the HD's compared to the regular ... I still find no fault with the regular Elixir Nanaweb PB's but will most likely continue to run the HD's on my 12-fret ... I may also try them on my older 814ce just to see if there is any difference/improvement ... so far I find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain ... try them out and make your own decision ..."
1,4,"These strings are really quite good, but I wouldn't call them perfect.  The unwound strings are not quite as bright as I am accustomed to, but they still ring nicely.  This is the only complaint I have about these strings.  If the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter, these would be 5-star strings.  As it stands, I give them 4.5 stars... not a big knock, actually.The low-end on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm.  I put these on a jumbo and it definitely accentuates the &#34;jumbo&#34; aspect of my acoustic.  The sound is very big, full, and nice.Definitely a recommended product!4.5/5 stars"
